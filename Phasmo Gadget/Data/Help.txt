	"Text":"●Ghosts always leave an EMF trace at he fuse box when they turned it on or off. What you can do is leave an EMF reader there, and it if goes off but the breaker doesn't turn on/off at that time - you've got a Jinn

●Crouching reduces your visible area to the ghost, and allows you to see the floor in dark areas

●Sprinting allows movement at ~1.8x for 3.5s with 5s cooldown - scales for partial use

●Bones can spawn in any unenclosed locations; will not spawn in cabinets, but can spawn inside raised door frames, towels and carpets

●All ghosts have a favourite room, but the \"ghost room\" refers only to the room the ghost is currently in

●Ghosts will slowly reduce the temperature of any room they're in, including during hunts

●Ghost events (ghost appearance, walking to a player, mist balls, and loud breaths) reduce the target's sanity by 10%. All ghost events target a single player, and the ghost can teleport near a player in order to perform an event

●While a ghost is manifested (ghost event or hunt), all players within the map lose 0.2% sanity per-second

●Mist ball/Smoke ball ghost events will not teleport the ghost

●Ghosts can only hear player microphones (and held electronics) in an 8m radius on the same floor [2 meters for Yokai during hunts]

●Speaking a ghost's name will increase their activity level for a short time

●A ghost will make the same ambient sound for every hunt; if the ghost makes a different sound, this is a ghost event

●Ghost events will turn off the light in the ghost room and close all adjacent doors (including exit doors)

●The breaker will always start on in Amateur difficulty, and off in all others

●Up to 9 lights switches may be on on small maps, 8 on medium, and 7 on large maps

●If the breaker is popped by turning on too many lights, all lights will be switched off

●All ghosts will occasionally roam from their room: small roams are common, large roams are rare

●Ghost can blink lights when near a light switch

●Player sanity will not drop below 50% during setup phase

●Every party member loses 15% sanity per player death

●Thermometers update slowly; have patience

●Freezing temps counts as below 0°C or 32°F, or if you see breath mist

●EMF values: 2 for interaction; 3 for throw; 4 for ghost event. 25% chance to become 5 for EMF 5 ghosts

●Truck EMF board registers EMF as 1 less than real values, with optional extra +/-1 variation: EMF 3 can show as 1, 2 or 3

●Spirit boxes will work anywhere inside the map, but the ghost will only listen to someone in a room with no lights on, within 3M of the ghost

●Ghost orbs only appear in the ghost's current room and as such can be used to track ghost movement

●DOTS sensors show periodic moving silhouettes of ghosts, if the ghost is in the room in interacting range

●Video and regular cameras can see ghost orbs. Ghost orbs move around the room and behave like bubbles

●Ghost writing books are considered by the ghost as standard interaction and throwable items, like random clutter. Removing clutter can increase the chances of the ghost interacting with a book

●When written in, ghost writing books will levitate and the pen will scribble - this can be observed via cameras

●A writing ghost will always write in the book if it throws it; if the book has moved and is empty, writing can be excluded

●Basic player speed is around 1.65m/s; sprint at 3m/s

●Hantu exact hunting speed temperature intervals: 1.4m/s at 15°C /
1.75m/s at 12°C /
2.1m/s at 9°C /
2.3m/s at 6°C /
2.5m/s at 3°C /
2.7m/s at 0°C

●Sanity drains passively in unlit areas (even dark spots in lit rooms) at 0.12% per-second on small maps, 0.08% on medium maps, 0.05% on large maps

●During setup phase, passive sanity drain is reduced:
0.09% on small maps,
0.05% on medium maps,
0.03% on large maps

●Passive sanity drains multiply depending on the difficulty: Intermediate is 1.5x, Professional is 2x

●If playing solo, all passive sanity drains are halved

●Once a crucifix prevents a hunt, the ghost may not attempt to hunt for 5s

●Smudge sticks prevent hunts within 6M range twice; at the start and 6s later. Smudges last for 90s and cannot be stacked

●Smudge sticks used during a hunt also initiate the standard smudge effect in preventing hunts until expiry

●Cameras can be used to take photos of fingerprints, footsteps, ghosts, bones, dead bodies, dirty water and general interactions

●Photo opportunities last 20s from inception. The closer, the better quality and the more money received

●For dirty water and ghost writing, two photos can be taken: once for the interaction event and another for the photo itself

●Sound sensors reveal room names in the truck, and indicate interactions within an area

●Paramic has 40M range (your ears hear further), but can detect inaudible interactions

●UV lights and glowsticks illuminate fingerprints and footsteps (fingerprints fade after 2m). Glowsticks dim after 1m

●Footsteps are made after the ghost steps in salt; place at chokepoints to increase chance

●Sanity pills raise individual sanity by 40% (amateur), 35% (intermed.), 30% (pro), 25% (nightmare)

●Candles prevent passive sanity loss within 1M radius (held or placed)

●Crucifixes prevent ghosts from hunting within 3M radius (held or placed)

●All maps will contain one cursed item: ouija board, tarot cards, voodoo doll or mirror. Each item has only one spawn point per map

●Cursed items will start a hunt when they run out or break

●Cursed hunts cannot be prevented, have a 1s grace period, are 20s longer, and subsequent hunts follow suit

●Ghosts make no noise during cursed hunts

●Ouija board will break when interacted with at 0% sanity

●Always say goodbye to the ouija board before walking away - or be hunted!

●Mirrors will show the area of the ghost room, but drain sanity by 7.5% per second

●Music boxes will attract a nearby ghost and make it sing and try to find the box; sanity drops when music is audible

●If the box is <5M from the ghost and the player gets close to the ghost during music, the ghost will spawn and upon reaching the music box or after 5s spawned, will attempt to hunt

●Using a voodoo doll will make the ghost perform an interaction or give evidence, at the cost of 10% sanity. The heart pin will trigger a hunt

●Using a voodoo doll at <10% sanity uses all pins and begins a hunt

●Using a summoning circle will cost 16% sanity per candle lit, and triggers a ghost event and subsequent cursed hunt

●Tarot cards: Tower forces interaction or evidence /
Devil forces ghost event /
Death forces hunt /
Fortune gives +/- 25% sanity /
Sun gives 100% sanity /
Moon takes 100% sanity /
Hermit returns ghost to their room /
Hanged Man kills the player /
Priestess revives dead teammate or banks an extra party life /
Fool does nothing

●Lighting the summoning circle during a hunt will result in your immediate death"

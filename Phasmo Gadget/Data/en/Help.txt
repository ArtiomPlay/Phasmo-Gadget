			"●Taking a photo of a cursed items, used or not, will yield a photo labelled as this item, and reward up to $5 and 5XP, depending on the distance it was taken from.",

			"●The Monkey Paw is one of the most versatile cursed possessions in the game, and can assist players in the completion of most objectives, especially as players can control when and where to employ its effects in order to quickly reach safety.",
			"",
			"●If not using the text UI, the Monkey Paw is always active when held. Be careful when speaking while holding it as you may accidentally call upon a wish.",
			"  ●This is especially notable when using push-to-talk, as there are bugs that make the Monkey Paw listen to the player even if no voice chat button is being pressed.",
			"",
			"●The vision loss from wishes is very significant, making it near impossible for a player afflicted by it to see more than a meter or so in front of them. While this can be partially circumvented by setting game brightness to a very high value, the affected player will be more or less rendered helpless and will need to be guarded accordingly.",
			"",
			"●The music box can be broken down into two primary uses:",
			"1) utilize the triggered ghost event and following hunt to complete relevant objectives or to identify the ghost type. Like with any other hunt-related activity, Smudge Sticks are highly recommended to avoid death",
			"2) get the ghost to broadcast its current position to narrow down and locate its favourite room.",
			"",
			"●The music box is an easy way to obtain a ghost photo. In multiplayer games, one way is to have the photographer carry the smudge stick while another player activates the music box. The player holding the music box should refill their sanity to a comfortable level to avoid a 0% sanity-triggered hunt.",
			"",
			"●Breaking the Ouija Board can be useful for completing several hunt-related objectives or earning photo rewards by taking a picture of the ghost.",
			"",
			"●You can quickly decrease a player's sanity by using the Ouija Board repeatedly, even while it's in the middle of answering another question.",
			"",
			"●You can repeatedly ask low-cost questions with the Ouija Board in order to create numerous interactions; with an EMF Reader nearby, EMF level 5 reading may be quickly attained, as each question has a 1/4 chance to give off the evidence.",
			"",
			"●When using voice chat to ask questions, wait at least a few seconds for the board to respond before asking again, to avoid breaking the board when asking high sanity-deducting questions.",
			"",
			"●Using a Tier 3 crucifix in range of the Summoning Circle will prevent the cursed hunt triggered after summoning the ghost, virtually removing the risk of the Circle.",
			"",
			"●To prevent a hunt starting before the ghost can be summoned, use incense or place crucifixes near the ghost just before lighting the circle.",
			"",
			"●Where needed, most Optional Objectives can be completed directly or indirectly using the Summoning Circle.",
			"  ●As such, it is best saved for after the ghost has been identified to quickly complete them.",
			"",
			"●Taking a photo of the centre of the circle will suffice, instead of attempting to have the entire circle in the photo.",
			"",
			"●The player should not draw a card during a hunt, since all cards drawn will be The Fool.",
			"",
			"●Players should take a photo of the cards before using them, as once all of the cards are used, the deck will disappear and no photo can be taken.",
			"",
			"●Though tarot cards cannot be drawn outside of the investigation area, this can currently be bypassed by drawing a card and leaving while the animation is still ongoing. The card will still take effect.",
			"  ●If, while using this method, no players are inside, drawing The Devil will do nothing, and drawing Death will not trigger a hunt but will still extend the duration of subsequent hunts.",
			"",
			"●Trying to take a ghost photo after drawing The Devil can sometimes be tricky, as the card's burning animation needs to be completed before the player can drop the deck. If the triggered event is a singing ghost event, taking the photo will be easier, as this type of event usually lasts longer than the others.",
			"  ●When playing in multiplayer, good coordination is useful if players want to take a ghost photo.",
			"",
			"●The voodoo doll is best saved for after the favourite room has been found. Use it for the ghost to interact with evidence sources rather than waiting extended periods for the ghost to do it on its own.",
			"",
			"●When using the voodoo doll with no sanity, all pressed remaining pins may cause multiple objects to be thrown at the same time. Be mindful of this to not confuse the ghost with a Poltergeist."

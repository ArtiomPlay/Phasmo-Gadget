			"Evidences:",
			"●EMF 5 is a random chance, so one would want to increase the chance of the ghost interacting with the environment. One can place some props in the ghost room for the ghost to throw. Make sure to turn off the room lights, as ghosts cannot throw items if the lights in its current room are on. Smudging the ghost or saying recognised phrases near the ghost can mildly increase the chance/rate of interactions.",
			"●It is possible to \"guess\" EMF Level 5 as an evidence using the site activity monitor, though this is not guaranteed. This is because the site activity monitor is an approximate representation of the total EMF currently present in the map, with a modifier of 0, -1 or -2 for each EMF generated. Hence, EMF level 5 can be \"guessed\" if multiple straight-line jumps of 4 and 5 levels are observed, especially if no players are currently inside the investigation area. Though an EMF 5 emission can be represented by an activity change of 3 levels, an EMF 3 is just as likely to do the same, so a jump of 3 levels is generally ignored.",
			"",
			"●Temperatures only decrease when the ghost is within a room, and although the ghost is more likely to stay in its ghost room, making it colder, freezing temperatures do not necessarily indicate the ghost room.",
			"●Additionally, temperatures do not return to normal immediately after a ghost leaves a room. This means that multiple rooms can be freezing at once, and that players should not assume that low or freezing temperatures guarantees that the ghost is still in that room.",
			"●Since 0.9.0, seeing cold breath is not an indicator of Freezing Temperatures.",
			"●If the fuse box is turned off at the start, Freezing Temperatures may be obtained quicker, depending on the weather and how often the ghost roams into other rooms. In particular, one could theoretically observe Freezing Temperatures in approximately two minutes if it is snowing, as long as the ghost stays in the same room for long enough.",
			"●As of 0.9.0, temperatures drop at 1/3 the current speed, if the temperature is below the weather's ambient temperature.",
			"●Nearly all ghosts can initiate an \"airball\" ghost event which is visually similar to the player's breath, other than in movement. The airball does not count as an indicator for low temperatures. The main difference is that the airball event usually moves towards a particular player, while cold breath never moves by itself.",
			"",
			"●For each type of door or surface that a fingerprint is possible, the fingerprint will always appear in the same spot. In addition, most doors of the same model will always have the fingerprints on only the push or pull side, but not both. For example, all Farmhouse-style doors will always have the fingerprints on the top-right corner of the door, and only appear on the \"push\" side. There are a few exceptions to these two rules; for example, one street/road house-style door may have the fingerprint on the \"push\" side while another identical door has it on the \"pull\" side, though they will always appear on the middle of the door.",
			"●Footprints can be useful to check for Ultraviolet evidence if the ghost is not interacting with doors in a timely fashion.",
			"●Footprints can sometimes be covered by certain furniture or carpets.",
			"",
			"●If a ghost throws a Ghost Writing Book, then it either does not have Ghost Writing as evidence, or is hiding it on reduced-evidence difficulties.",
			"",
			"●Because of the periodical moving of Ghost Orbs, searching for them with a hand-held Video Camera is often better than relying on stationary cameras. In addition, this eliminates back-and-forth trips to the truck, especially on larger maps where sanity preservation is more important.",
			"●A player in the truck can view their teammates' Tier I head gear during the initial search for the ghost room to search for Ghost Orbs.",
			"●If viewing the camera feed from the truck, camera placement is key to detecting Ghost Orbs. A good strategy for detecting them is placing two video cameras in the corners of the room facing each other to maximize coverage, or using a Tier 2 or 3 tripod to rotate the camera.",
			"●Using video cameras to peer through exit doors, garage doors or windows may allow the player to find Ghost Orbs even before entering the investigation area.",
			"●Ghost Orbs tend to show up in regular intervals. If none are seen for a long time, try moving the video camera or switch to another one.",
			"●In outdoor areas such as on Maple Lodge Campsite, Ghost Orbs can be hard to see in bad weather conditions (primarily rain, snow, and fog). A hint to distinguishing them from snowflakes is that Ghost Orbs tend to float more horizontally and, sometimes, even upwards (compared to snowflakes always falling down). Additionally, snowflakes are generally dark, while orbs will be bright.",
			"●It is best to check for Ghost Orbs when the room's lights are off. When on, the brightness may hide the Orbs from sight.",
			"",
			"Equipment:",
			"●A good way to see the D.O.T.S silhouette clearly is to have the room lights turned off and use a video camera with night vision on, then look either directly through the video camera screen or the computer. This will increase the silhouette's contrast against the background. Having two D.O.T.S Projectors placed can allow the silhouette to be visible for longer as it moves across the lighting radius.",

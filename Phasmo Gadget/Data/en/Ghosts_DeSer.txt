    Info On Ghost:
        Strength
            ●Focuses on the same player until that player is killed or has left the game
        Abilities
            ●Performs singing ghost events more often than other ghost types
            ●Frequently roams to target player outside of hunts
        Weakness(es)
            ●Cannot kill players other than the target if the target is inside
            ●Can produce a unique screech on the parabolic microphone

        ●The Banshee has a higher chance of performing singing ghost events over other types
        ●If all of the following Abilitiess are met:
            ●The ghost event is a singing event
            ●The ghost event is targeted towards the hunt target
            ●The hunt target causes the Banshee to disappear prematurely (by going near it)
        ●Then the hunt target's sanity will decrease by 15%, instead of the usual 10%
        ●Like other ghosts, who the Banshee targets for a ghost event is random and based on distance; being the hunt target by itself does not increase their chance of being the ghost event target
        ●For female ghosts, there are 2 other singing vocalizations that are not considered true singing events, hence the Banshee's sanity deduction from these is the standard 10%
        ●When in a D.O.T.S. state, the Banshee will try to move towards its hunt target instead of the nearest player
        ●The Banshee cannot change favorite rooms by itself in any difficulty. This can be overridden via the sanity wish when using the Monkey Paw
        ●When the Banshee performs a roam outside of hunts, if the hunt target is inside the investigation area, it has a 2/3 (67%) chance of triggering its ability which makes it roam to the target. The ability fails if the ghost and the hunt target are on different floors except if:
            ●The map is Point Hope
            ●The Banshee was in a basement or an attic for all other maps
        ●When a Parabolic Microphone is used, the Banshee has a 33% chance of making a unique shriek-like paranormal sound instead of a regular whisper
        ●At the start of the game a player is randomly selected as the hunt target. If the hunt target leaves the game or dies, a new hunt target will be selected.
        ●The Banshee's hunt threshold is 50%, but it only checks the target's sanity when trying to hunt, rather than the average sanity like other ghost types, meaning that only the target needs to be at or below 50% sanity for it to attempt to hunt. As a result, the Banshee can appear to start hunting from as high as 87% average sanity, or as low as 12% average sanity, on the Sanity Monitor, depending on the target's current sanity and number of other players
        ●When a Banshee hunts, it will mostly follow standard hunt rules, but it will ignore all players other than its hunt target. It will not attempt to chase other players nor will it kill them, even if it comes into direct contact with a non-target player, instead passing through them. The Banshee will react to Incense lit by other players within range, but this will not allow for completion of the "Repel a ghost while it is chasing someone" optional objective unless the Banshee is also chasing its target when this occurs
        ●If the hunt target is outside the building, the Banshee will still use its target's sanity to decide whether to hunt. However, if it does hunt, it will hunt like any other ghost, chasing any opportune player

        ●Identifying the target player of a Banshee both conclusively identifies it and can provide players with a significant edge, such as making hunt-related objectives much easier, and enabling the other players to continue investigating during hunts with impunity, though it is important to note that the target player must be inside the investigation area for this to be applicable. Alternatively, the target player can altogether prevent hunts indefinitely by topping up their sanity with Sanity Medication and staying outside the investigation area to never drop below the hunt threshold, for a completely safe investigation. There are several methods players may use to identify a Banshee's target:
            ●Banshees will only check for the individual sanity level of the target player when attempting to hunt. If the ghost hunts above the average sanity of 50%, and one or more players are below 50% sanity, then one of them is the target. Likewise, if the ghost refrains from hunting at below 50% average sanity, but one player has high sanity, they can be presumed to be the Banshee's target; be mindful of mistaking it with ghosts that have different hunt sanity thresholds such as Demons or Shades
            ●Having players act as "bait" with Incense and/or escape routes ready can definitively identify the target. Bait players should stand in plain sight and attempt to actively attract the ghost, such as talking into the microphone or holding active electronics; if the ghost ignores them, have another player repeat the process then proceed by elimination until the target is found. Alternatively, multiple players can do this at a time, standing separate from each-other and seeing which of them the Banshee rushes for. This method, though more risky, is useful either when the sanity-based method proves inconclusive, or when playing on Nightmare/Insanity difficulty where the Sanity Monitor is not available. Ensure that all players are inside the building when performing this test
                ●Be aware that the Banshee might coincidentally wander towards a player after it has lost sight of its target, especially in hallways or cluttered rooms, giving the impression that it is chasing that player. In that case, observe its line of sight acceleration or attempt to move out of its way to see if the ghost is actively following you
            ●Banshees tend to wander towards their target outside of hunts; a player reporting frequent activity or even hunts starting near them and far away from the ghost room is most likely the target. Using motion sensors and salt can help to track the ghost's location
        ●Note that if the target player dies or disconnects, a new target will be selected. This also applies on Nightmare/Insanity difficulty or when the "Kills extend hunts" setting is turned on: if the Banshee manages to kill its target, it will immediately select another player and continue hunting
        ●On singleplayer, determining the Banshee by its target ability is impossible, making it much more difficult to identify through behavior alone, so one must rely on other potential tells or pieces of evidence. Using a Parabolic Microphone to pick up its unique vocalization might come in handy, though note that the Banshee only has a chance of producing its shriek, so it mustn't be ruled out simply because only whispers were heard multiple times in a row. Other singleplayer tells include a lot of singing events, and wandering to the player frequently (note that Phantoms also have this ability; theirs will, however, leave an EMF reading while Banshees will not.)

    Hints:
        ●

    Info On Ghost:
        Strength
            ●Lower hunt cooldown than other ghosts
            ●Higher hunt sanity threshold
            ●Smudging prevents hunts for shorter
        Abilities
            ●Rare chance to hunt at any sanity percentage
        Weakness(es)
            ●Increased effective crucifix range

        ●The Demon has an ability that allows it to automatically start a hunt, regardless of current average sanity. There is no particular behaviour or condition (such as requiring line-of-sight with a player) that affects if it activates or not; if it decides to use its ability, it will hunt. This hunt can be blocked by normal prevention methods
        ●Because the Demon's ability hunt is governed by the "ability phase", these hunts occur much less frequently than hunts derived from being below its sanity threshold. Additionally, as this is not a "proper" hunt attempt, the Demon can technically attempt to use its ability during the setup phase on Amateur and Intermediate difficulties. However, it will fail and there will be no hunt as hunts cannot occur at all during the setup phase
        ●The Demon has a normal hunt sanity threshold of 70%, instead of the standard 50%. This does not affect and is independent from its hunt ability, although the hunt does not differ in any way
        ●Demons have a minimum cooldown of 20 seconds between hunts, instead of the usual 25 seconds
        ●Smudging a Demon will prevent hunts for only 60 seconds, as opposed to the standard 90 seconds
        ●As a weakness, the effective range of a crucifix is 50% larger than the standard range:
            ●4.5 metres instead of 3 for Tier I
            ●6 metres instead of 4 for Tier II
            ●7.5 metres instead of 5 for Tier III

        ●Generally, it is best to think of the Demon as having a 100% hunt sanity threshold, even if its hunts are rarer above 70% average sanity
        ●To identify a Demon by its traits, players may time the cooldown between hunts, or watch out for signs of a very early hunt. Given the Demon's relative aggressiveness in hunting, players should plan their route to the ghost room and what they wish to bring for any objectives, while considering whether to hide or to use Incense on the ghost if it hunts. Sprint may need to be conserved once approaching the ghost room in order to make a quick escape in the event of a sudden hunt. If a very early hunt occurs, make sure to rule out the possibility of a cursed hunt caused by another player using a cursed possession without the rest of the team's knowledge
        ●With the crucifix's increased effective range, preventing hunts will generally be easier, though difficulties may still be encountered in massive rooms, such as the Basketball Court of Brownstone High School
        Identification
            ●Players can use two tests:
                ●Time the hunt cooldown: a cooldown of less than 25 seconds (excluding hunts caused by cursed possessions) may indicate a Demon. If it uses a crucifix charge in this time, this may also be indicative of a Demon
                ●Time the smudge hunt prevention: a ghost hunting between 60 - 90 seconds after being smudged correctly may indicate a Demon
            ●Take care to ensure that the timing is correct to avoid misidentification -- usage of a stopwatch may be helpful. In particular, if a ghost is still under the effect of a previous smudge, smudging again will not reset the timer, which may throw off timing; wait for the ghost to attempt another hunt before smudging again. Note that ghosts do not necessarily hunt after the cooldown is over; having hunts consistently being more than 25 seconds apart does not necessarily eliminate the Demon as a possibility.

    Info On Ghost:
        Strength
            ●Always knows where players are during a hunt
            ●Moves at a high speed with no player nearby
        Abilities
            ●Can produce a unique response through the Spirit Box
        Weakness(es)
            ●Significantly slows down when near its target
            ●Has a lower hunt sanity threshold

        ●If the player asks any question through the Spirit Box while standing within 1 metre of the Deogen, it has a 33% chance with each question to produce a unique response of constant heavy bull-like breathing, instead of a regular response
        ●The Deogen's hunt sanity threshold is 40%, instead of the usual 50%
        ●During a hunt, the Deogen always has line-of-sight with all players on the map; in other words, it does not use the "roaming" mechanic. When the hunt begins, the Deogen will pick the nearest player (by straight-line distance) to move towards. It will occasionally "refresh" and repick the nearest target throughout the hunt. One can also use Incense to stun the Deogen temporarily and force it to change its target when the smudge effect runs out
        ●When the Deogen is chasing a player, its speed is based on its pathfinding distance to the target player and has three thresholds: above 6 meters, between 6 and 2.5 meters and below 2.5 meters
            ●> 6m: 3 m/s
            ●Between 2.5 - 6m: Assumed speed gradient between 0.4 - 3 m/s
            ●< 2.5m: 0.4 m/s
        ●If the Deogen is smudged or is otherwise not chasing any player, its speed will remain at its current speed, or 1.6 m/s if its current speed is greater than 3 m/s. Otherwise, the Deogen does not alter its speed based on line-of-sight while chasing a player
        ●During a hunt, the Deogen flickers and is on average invisible for shorter and visible for longer compared to most other ghosts

        Hunt
            ●If you have not ruled the Deogen out, it is best to choose a hiding spot which you can easily leave before the Deogen corners you, or have Incense prepared. Once a Deogen is close enough to the player for its weakness to kick in, it becomes the slowest ghost in the game. Provided players do not accidentally trap themselves in a tight space with no way out, surviving a Deogen is almost trivial as it is impossible for it to catch up to its targets so long as they keep moving, as it becomes so slow that it is slower than the player's default movement speed. In some cases, it may even be possible to skirt the ghost in a way that would normally be impossible with other ghosts, such as in the kitchen of 42 Edgefield Road. Looping the Deogen around a piece of furniture (e.g. a kitchen island) at a moderate speed is common practice; on bigger maps such as Sunny Meadows or Brownstone High School, the player might not even have to loop it, and can simply walk around the map and lead it on a tour
            ●It is worth noting that when the Deogen is stunned with smudge sticks, it will maintain the speed at it was at when affected; in most cases, the Deogen will be moving at its minimum speed, meaning that the Deogen will only roam a very short distance before being able to chase players again
            ●When playing in multiplayer, keep server lag in mind; if you misjudge the ghost's server-side position and move away too late, it may kill you. Since the Deogen only switches targets periodically and not in real time, avoid having players stand behind each other to prevent the Deogen from rushing into another player to reach its target, because the Deogen can kill non-targets unlike the Banshee
        Identification
            ●The most straightforward form of identification is for the ghost to hunt; if it approaches the nearest player at high speeds and slows down drastically as it approaches, then it is a Deogen. Note that a "young" Thaye, a Revenant that has detected someone, and a Hantu when the power has been out for a while and room temperatures are at their lowest, may move at similar speeds, but without slowing down drastically (if at all); mistaking them for a Deogen can be deadly. A non-hunt way would be to constantly track the ghost and look for the signature heavy breathing through the spirit box, though this will be more tedious, especially in large rooms. The easiest way to do this is using a Tier III Motion Sensor; because the spherical radius of the sensor is only slightly larger than the distance required to obtain heavy breathing, using the Spirit Box on top of the Motion Sensor when it triggers has a good chance of producing the unique Deogen response
        Miscellaneous
            ●Deogens are among the easiest ghosts to take a ghost photo of, partly due to being invisible for shorter and visible for longer, and partly due to their hunt mechanics meaning they almost always end up staying near a player, giving players plenty of time to snap a photo; keep a photo camera handy if needed

    Info On Ghost:
        Strength
            ●Usually shows itself passing through D.O.T.S on video camera only with no players nearby
        Weakness(es)
            ●Less likely to wander
            ●Cannot change favourite rooms
            
        ●When performing a roam, the Goryo can only perform short roams, rather than either short or long roams
        ●The Goryo will not leave its favourite room as often as other ghosts and cannot change favourite rooms by itself in any difficulty. This can be overridden via the sanity wish when using the Monkey Paw
        ●The Goryo will only enter in a D.O.T.S state if no players are in the same room as the ghost. In addition, its D.O.T.S silhouette is only visible through a Video Camera, and cannot be seen with the naked eye. A Goryo will still manifest normally during ghost events and hunts with its ghost model, which does not require any special equipment to be seen

        ●It is necessary to have a Video Camera either placed facing an active D.O.T.S. Projector, or held by a player outside the ghost's room. If D.O.T.S. evidence is visible in the camera's screen, but invisible in direct view, the ghost is likely to be a Goryo. Conversely, if D.O.T.S. is seen without the aid of a video camera, a Goryo can be safely ruled out. Turning up device or in-game brightness may help when trying to rule out a Goryo
        ●Ghost events only need the player to be somewhat near the ghost, and the ghost does not need to roam to perform them, only teleporting if applicable. Hence, having ghost events happening a distance away from the favourite room does not rule out the Goryo
        ●If you do not obtain D.O.T.S Projector as one of the ghost's evidences on Nightmare/Insanity difficulty or on a limited evidence custom game (1/2 evidence), then the Goryo can be safely ruled out. On a 0 evidence run, the Goryo is near-impossible to identify with certainty, as it cannot be identified through its D.O.T.S ability; Try waiting a while to see if the ghost changes its favourite room at low sanity, or use motion sensors and salt to track how far it travels in one go

    Info On Ghost:
        Strength
            ●Moves quicker in colder areas during hunts
        Abilities
            ●Can emit frosty breath when hunting with the breaker off
        Weakness(es)
            ●Moves slower in warmer areas during hunts

        ●The Hantu cannot turn on the fuse box, and is twice as likely to turn it off
        ●During a hunt, the Hantu's speed is affected by the temperature of the room that it goes through:
            ●Room temperature - Ghost speed (m/s)
            ●> 15°C (59°F) - 1.4
            ●12–15°C (53.6–59°F) - 1.75
            ●9–12°C (48.2–53.6°F) - 2.1
            ●6–9°C (42.8–48.2°F) - 2.3
            ●3–6°C (37.4–42.8°F) - 2.4
            ●0–3°C (32–37.4°F) - 2.5
            ●< 0°C (32°F) - 2.7
        ●Unlike most other ghosts, the Hantu does not have line-of-sight acceleration during hunts
        ●During a hunt, the Hantu will emit freezing breath near its head in any room as long as the fuse box is off. Dead players cannot see this breath. As this is not actual "evidence", it can appear on any difficulty

        ●Temperature plays an important role in both identifying and defending against a Hantu. In general, Hantus will be most powerful within and near the ghost room, where low and freezing temperatures are most likely to be. Thus, it is important that players get away from the ghost (room) as soon as a hunt begins, as the Hantu can quickly catch someone within its vicinity. Hantus are particularly dangerous during Light Snow weather, especially on the outdoors maps of Maple Lodge Campsite and Camp Woodwind, as ambient room temperatures will generally be lower if the fuse box is off, boosting their speed during a hunt
        ●In general, leaving the breaker turned on is a safer strategy, though one can also turn it off to aid in identification, if needed
        Identification
            ●There are three ways to identify a Hantu:
                ●Leave the fuse box turned on for a while, then listen for its speed during a hunt. If it is faster in colder rooms (usually, but not always the favourite room), and slower than a normal ghost in a warm room, then it is a Hantu
                    ●If it is a Raiju, then the ghost will be fast near active electronics and a normal speed outside a specified range. If this is a no-evidence game, try removing all electronics first. If at least one piece of evidence is provided, then having Freezing Temperatures as a piece of evidence will eliminate Raiju
                    ●The Moroi can also speed up over several hunts or even during a hunt, but as a result of gradually lowering average sanity instead. Ensure that all players maintain their sanities at a constant level
                ●Leave the breaker turned on for a while, then loop it around a large piece of furniture in a warm room during a hunt, carrying Incense to avoid death. If the ghost does not speed up quickly with line-of-sight (within ~10 seconds), then it is likely a Hantu. It is worth noting the mere presence of the ghost in that room will cool it down and make it increasingly harder to loop over time; this is usually irrelevant in small maps which have shorter hunt durations, and looping a Hantu for an entire hunt is feasible, but on medium and large maps and/or when the hunt duration is extended by cursed hunts, such looping should not be done over an extended period of time, or alternatively one should utilize a loop or series of loops that spans multiple rooms
                ●The Hantu's ability to emit freezing breath when the breaker is off can be used to definitively identify it without evidence, though it is more risky than the above strategies. Look closely! Use Incense to stun it while it's hunting
            ●If you do not obtain Freezing Temperatures as one of the ghost's types of evidence on a limited evidence custom game (1/2 evidence), then the Hantu can be safely ruled out
            ●The Hantu is one of two ghosts (the other being the Onryo) for which you can collect all three pieces of evidence without excluding The Mimic. Therefore, before concluding you're dealing with a Hantu, confirm that it is actually a Hantu using the above methods and/or check whether the Spirit Box gives a response. If it does, you have The Mimic instead

    Info On Ghost:
        Strength
            ●Gets a speed boost when chasing a player that is far away
        Abilities
            ●Occasionally attempts to zap the sanity of nearby players
        Weakness(es)
            ●Cannot use any of its abilities when the fuse box is off
            ●Cannot turn off the fuse box

        ●The Jinn cannot directly turn off the fuse box. However, it can still indirectly turn off the fuse box by turning too many lights on and overloading it
        ●There is a popular myth claiming the Jinn will interact with electronics often rather than other interactions; this is not true. The Jinn has an equal chance of interacting with anything nearby
        ●When near a player and the fuse box is on, the Jinn will occasionally use an ability that lowers the sanity of one player in the same room or otherwise within 3 meters of it by 25%. The player who will lose sanity is the first in the list (established by the order the players joined the lobby) among players in range. An EMF 2 or 5 reading will then be generated at the fuse box
        ●During a hunt, if all of the following three criteria are satisfied:
            ●The fuse box is turned on
            ●The Jinn has line-of-sight with a player it is targeting
            ●The Jinn is further than 3 metres from that player
        ●Then its speed will be fixed at 2.5 m/s while the criteria are met. Otherwise, it will obey standard ghost speeds with one particularity: while it is travelling at the fixed 2.5 m/s speed, the speed increase from continuous line-of-sight adds in the background, and will be applied once one criteria is no longer satisfied
        ●Whether there are lights turned on or not does not affect the Jinn's abilities

        Turning off the location's breaker will prevent the Jinn from using any of its abilities. However, this will render the map's electrical lights inactive, leading to players' sanity draining as a consequence of being in the dark more often. Players will need to decide if preventing the Jinn from using its abilities is worth dealing with more frequent hunts as a result of lower average sanity, though this loss can be mitigated by holding lit candles to reduce passive sanity drain
        Identification
            ●There are two ways to identify a Jinn, both methods with the breaker turned on:
                ●Wait for a hunt at the end of a long room or corridor, standing far away from where the ghost is expected to enter the room, and with line-of-sight all the way through. Listen for its footsteps and observe its speed before and after it sees the player. If it instantly gains speed to chase the player, then it is likely a Jinn; use Incense if needed
                ●Leave an EMF reader at the fuse box while the fuse box is on; if it picks up a reading but the fuse box never turned off, then it is very likely the Jinn using its ability, barring any other items that could have caused the reading (such as the fuse box door itself)
            ●Keep in mind that a fuse box turning off on its own does not rule out a Jinn, as they can still indirectly turn off fuse boxes by turning on too many lights and causing the fuse box to trip. If a fuse box trips, all light switches will also turn off, which can be used to distinguish from a ghost manually turning the fuse box off, which leaves light switches untouched

            ●May turn off a light immediately after a player turns one on
            ●Chooses unlit rooms to remain in more often
        Weakness(es)
            ●Hunts at a lower sanity threshold in a lit room
        
        ●Mares cannot interact with lights to turn them on, and they are more likely to choose turning off lights as an interaction
        ●The Mare does not have any affinity with computer monitors, televisions, and the fuse box, and can turn them on or off like most other ghosts
        ●When the Mare roams, it is more likely to choose an unlit room to roam into than a lit room, and therefore has a higher chance to change its favourite room if the current one is lit
        ●The Mare has a higher chance of performing light-shattering ghost events over other types, as this will disable the lights, making it easier to hunt
        ●If a player turns on a light that is within 4 metres of a Mare, it has a small chance of turning the light off almost immediately. Each light has a minimum cooldown per player of 10 seconds after it has been turned on or off, and interacting with the light again before the cooldown ends will restart it and cancel the Mare's attempt to use this ability.[1][2][note 1] The Mare can use this ability even if the fuse box is turned off or broken,[3] but not if the light is shattered.[4] The ability also works during a ghost event
        ●A Mare has a modified hunt sanity threshold depending on whether the room it is currently in is lit. If the lights are turned off, the hunt sanity threshold is increased to 60%, and if the lights are turned on, the threshold is decreased to 40%. This applies even if the fuse box is turned off or broken, but not if the room's lights are destroyed. Other sources of light, such as brought-in equipment and Firelights, do not affect this threshold

        ●Players should be cautious when using the Spirit Box or looking for Ghost Orbs to verify the ghost's current location or favourite room, as the Mare is more likely to hunt when the lights in its room are off, potentially catching players dangerously close to the Mare when it begins to hunt
        ●Once a Mare is identified, there are two ways to counteract it:
            ●Leave the lights in its favourite room and neighbouring rooms turned on. This will lower its hunt sanity threshold
            ●Once the sanity threshold is below 40%, the Mare will be able to hunt regardless of whether the lights are on or not. Hence, it may be wise to leave the lights in its favourite room turned off. This way, the Mare is less likely to wander away, and will be more likely to hunt in that room, making it less dangerous than a case where the Mare is constantly roaming into other rooms (and possibly changing its favourite room)
        ●In both cases, keeping a player near the light switches can help to counteract the Mare's ability if they are turned off by the ghost or from an electrical overload
        ●Whether the lights are turned on or off do not affect the Mare's chance of performing a light-shattering ghost event. Where possible, avoid staying in rooms where you want the lights turned on, so that the Mare is less likely to shatter them
        Identification
            ●The Mare is generally one of the more difficult ghosts to identify based on behaviour, though one can look for the following:
                ●The ability to turn a light back off the moment a player turns it on: try to pause a few seconds between turning the lights on
                ●A preference for light-shattering ghost events
                ●A ghost that hunts slightly earlier in the dark or slightly later in the light, though this is not very reliable
                ●If you tend to keep the lights near the ghost turned on, and you find the ghost frequently wandering into dark rooms that players have not entered, and changing favourite rooms frequently on Professional and Nightmare difficulties, then the ghost could be a Mare
            ●A ghost turning on the light directly eliminates the possibility of it being a Mare. On the other hand, any ghost may choose to never turn on a light throughout the entire game, so this negative should not be used to confirm the ghost type. In fact, any ghost may turn off a light immediately after you turn it on purely by chance. Ghost events which turn the lights off during/after do not count for this (Mare) ability

    Info On Ghost:
        Strength
            ●Hunting speeds depend directly on average team sanity
        Abilities
            ●Can curse players through the spirit box or the parabolic microphone, making them lose sanity faster
        Weakness(es)
            ●Will be disoriented for longer when smudged during a hunt

        ●The Moroi has an ability to "curse" a target through the following ways:
            ●By successfully obtaining a response from the Spirit Box; this will curse the person who "caused" the response, either by asking questions or triggering the failsafe
            ●By hearing whispers through the parabolic microphone
        ●When a player is cursed, their passive sanity drain is doubled, being in a lit area will no longer prevent sanity drain, and the light from Firelights will no longer mitigate against sanity loss. Walking outside of the investigation area will still pause sanity drain until they enter again. Consuming Sanity Medication removes the curse for that player. Players that have been cursed before in the contract can be cursed again. Multiple players can be cursed at the same time, but curses do not stack on a single player
        ●The Moroi's speed is dependent on the average sanity at the beginning of the hunt. The base speed increases by an average of 0.083 m/s for every 5% average sanity below its average hunt threshold of 50%. The list below shows each possible base speed for the Moroi:
            ●Average sanity % - Base ghost speed
            ●≥ 45%-1.5 m/s
            ●40%-45% - 1.583 m/s
            ●35%-40% - 1.66 m/s
            ●30%-35% - 1.749 m/s
            ●25%-30% - 1.832 m/s
            ●20%-25% - 1.915 m/s
            ●15%-20% - 1.998 m/s
            ●10%-15% - 2.081 m/s
            ●5%-10% - 2.164 m/s
            ●0%-5% - 2.25 m/s
        ●The Moroi's speed changes during a hunt according to the current average sanity. Unlike most other ghosts with speed bonuses, the Moroi accelerates with continuous line-of-sight of a player. Below 5% average sanity, the maximum speed of a Moroi is 3.71 m/s, almost 25% faster than the Revenant's 3 m/s
        ●When using an Incense during a hunt, the duration where the Moroi cannot see nor kill players is 7.5 seconds instead of 5

        ●Given the Moroi's ability to drain sanity after responding through the Spirit Box, it is recommended to refrain from utilizing the Spirit Box after obtaining the first response. If necessary, only the player who previously asked questions should use the Spirit Box again. Where needed, timely intervention in the form of Sanity Medication can be used to break the curse. Usage of Parabolic Microphones should also be limited, and if required for an objective, should also be done by the player that previously used the Spirit Box
        Identification
        ●The easiest way to identify a Moroi is by paying attention to the ghost's speed:
            ●Listen for the ghost's speed both over multiple hunts and during a given hunt, as average sanity lowers; a ghost that speeds up over the course of multiple hunts as average sanity lowers, or gradually speeds up during wandering when all players are hiding, could be a Moroi. Remember to take into account line-of-sight acceleration, if applicable. Note that the Hantu will increase in speed if the fuse box is left off as the temperature in the map decreases, but it does not speed up through line-of-sight; either keep the fuse box turned on to avoid misidentification, or make sure that the ghost does not have the Hantu's signature freezing breath during a chase with the power off
            ●As an alternate strategy, Sanity Medication can be utilized during a hunt. As the Moroi's roaming speed changes in real time as average sanity changes, a significant increase of it while it's hunting will cause the Moroi to slow down, potentially identifying it in the span of a single hunt, while also potentially bolstering sanity enough to get the team above hunt range afterwards. All players should be hidden (or, most optimally, having been hidden from the start) to avoid the speed loss being confused for a ghost's deceleration from line-of-sight or the Revenant's losing track of players, and to wait a few seconds in order to get a read on its roaming speed before using the medication to note if the Moroi begins to slow down afterwards. Additionally, a marked degree of coordination in multiplayer is required, as multiple uses will be needed to raise average sanity enough to cause the Moroi to lose a definitive amount of speed. This strategy is much more reliable when using Tier II or III sanity medication in order to have sanity increase more quickly, which will both exacerbate this effect and reduce the odds that the hunt ends before sanity restoration kicks in sufficiently. Alternatively, if the player has high sanity levels, the opposite method can be done by using cursed possessions to rapidly drop sanity during a hunt and seeing if the Moroi speeds up
            ●If starting a cursed hunt early on during the contract, it is extremely likely that the average sanity will be above 45% and the Moroi's roaming speed will be its minimum 1.5 m/s, slower than most ghosts. Keep in mind The Twins will have a base speed of 1.53 m/s when starting a hunt at its present location, which is nearly indistinguishable from a Moroi's speed when above 45% sanity
        ●Another way to identify the Moroi is by smudging it during a hunt. The Moroi will be blinded for 7.5 seconds instead of 5. Noticing a blinding time longer than usual can indicate a Moroi. This will be more easily noticeable with tier II and tier III Incense as the ghost is slowed down during the blinding effect
        ●When the sanity monitor is available, one can also identify a Moroi based on its ability: if your sanity has drained much more than normal after a Spirit Box response or a whisper on the parabolic microphone, especially if you've been in fully lit rooms and/or holding a Firelight for extended periods of time, then you have most likely been cursed by a Moroi. Take into account sanity drain from ghost events, if any, as well as if you have used any cursed possessions throughout the mission

    Info On Ghost:
        Strength
            ●Has quieter footsteps and vocalizations during hunts
        Weakness(es)
            ●Produces paranormal sounds more frequently

        ●The Myling produces paranormal sounds (that can only be heard through a Parabolic Microphone) more often than other ghosts
        ●When hunting, a Myling's footstep and vocalizations sounds will only be audible to players within 12 meters – slightly greater than the range required for electronic interference – instead of the usual 20 meters. The volume of footsteps is slightly muffled near the limit, but quickly becomes discernible as it approaches

        Behavioural identification
            ●The best way to identify a Myling is taking advantage of the small difference between its audible range (12m) and the electronic interference range (10m), and having a rough intuition of these ranges. If the ghost's sounds are very faint or not audible at all at the threshold of the interference range, then it is probably a Myling. Note that this test is not valid if the ghost is on a different floor, since this will muffle the audible range. This can be tested in multiple ways, such as:
                ●Before a hunt, dropping an active (preferably silent) electronic equipment at your preferred hiding spot, then looking for the behaviour during the hunt
                ●Holding an active electronic equipment or using Global Chat during a hunt, with incense for protection
            ●Note that the Raiju has a larger interference range (15m), which may create a similar effect. Use other methods (such as ghost speed) to eliminate the Raiju
            Paranormal sounds
                ●Although the Myling creates paranormal sounds more often, this is generally unreliable due to randomisation, and that it is often difficult to pinpoint the ghost's exact location, leading to the player missing out on some sounds
        Surviving hunts
            ●On larger maps, especially in long hallways, it is prudent to visually look out for the ghost, as its reduced audible range gives it a mild advantage in catching a player off guard, while also gaining speed for longer if line-of-sight was achieved

    Info On Ghost:
        Strength
            ●Fingerprints can disappear faster than usual
            ●Occasionally fails to leave fingerprints
        Abilities
            ●Has a chance to blink in a different ghost model when hunting
        Weakness(es)
            ●Can leave a unique fingerprint pattern

        ●Each time the Obake interacts with a valid surface, it has a 75% chance of leaving fingerprints, instead of the usual 100%. After stepping in salt, it also has a 75% chance each step, instead of 100%, of leaving a footstep sound
        ●When creating handprints or fingerprints, there is a one-sixth (~16.7%)[1] chance for the Obake to create a unique handprint/fingerprint pattern:
            ●A six-fingered handprint instead of the usual five fingers
            ●Two fingerprints instead of one on light switches, lamps, and TV remotes
            ●Five fingerprints instead of four on keyboards and Prison cell doors
        ●The Obake occasionally triggers an ability to reduce the remaining time for all existing fingerprints on the map by half. For example, two fingerprints lingering on the map with 40 seconds and 70 seconds before timing out and disappearing are cut in half to 20 and 35 seconds remaining respectively. This ability can be triggered multiple times in quick succession, making it possible for an instance of fingerprints to last for mere seconds before vanishing
        ●When performing a fake hunt ghost event or a Music Box event, the Obake is the only ghost that will sometimes miss a footstep sound. This is very likely a bug
        ●During a hunt, the Obake will occasionally shapeshift into a different ghost model of the same gender during a flicker. Dead players cannot see this shapeshift
        ●A shapeshift will always occur on the 12th, 27th, 39th, 54th, 62nd, 80th, 105th, 120th, and 132nd flickers (starting with the first flicker-in) of a hunt
            ●This means that the first shapeshift will happen approximately 7 - 9 seconds after the grace period ends.
            ●This also means that the Obake will not shapeshift at all if the hunt ends prematurely (after the ghost kills a player or when all players leave the investigation area), as it will not have the time to reach the 12th flicker
        ●When shapeshifting, the Obake has an order of models it will use. The first shapeshift of the contract will always be using the first ghost model in the following list. The second shapeshift will then use the second model, the third one the third model, and so on with the list looping on itself. When the Obake reaches its own model in the list, it will shapeshift into itself with a more or less visible posture reset
        ●Both the shapeshifting and the fingerprint duration's reduction will count as an ability in the post-game statistics

        ●If the ghost touches a surface and leaves no fingerprints, then later leaves fingerprints on another surface, or vice versa, this usually points to the ghost being an Obake
        ●If an Obake is suspected, checking a touched surface with a UV Light each time it interacts with a door or the like is prudent to spotting the Obake's special fingerprints, both to maximize the chances of spotting them and to note any instances of them rapidly disappearing. Note that getting normal fingerprints, even several times repeatedly, does not rule out an Obake outright
        ●Although the Obake has a 75% chance to leave Ultraviolet evidence, due to probability, it is possible for the Obake to always leave fingerprints on surfaces that it touches much like any other ghost with Ultraviolet. It's also possible for an Obake to interact with nearby doors frequently enough that it can effectively "mask" an instance where it does not leave fingerprints during one interaction by instead providing them in a separate interaction moments later, as well as conceal its ability to quickly decay its fingerprints
        ●If you are on a zero-evidence run, the Obake will never produce fingerprints nor footprints, and hence can only be identified spotting its shapeshifting power during a hunt. In multiplayer, one player can stay in the investigation area and hide while other players can look through set-up cameras in safety while the ghost is hunting; in singleplayer, strong looping skills are very favorable in order to maintain sight on it for extended periods of time to catch it changing models during a flicker. Use of Incense or Tier III Salt can make the task significantly easier in that regard; This tends to become much easier if the ghost is using the child or Patient 07 model, as those models can also be crawling (or bent backwards in the case of Patient 07), and will reset to the normal standing posture when it shifts, resulting in a sudden, extremely obvious posture change for a single blink
        ●Note that there are difficulty settings that can change the default chance of a fingerprint being left on a surface, as well as the decay timer. Keep this in mind when playing on such custom difficulties

    Info On Ghost:
        Strength
            ●More active when people are nearby
        Weakness(es)
            ●Cannot produce "airball" ghost events
            ●Model remains visible for longer periods when hunting

        ●The Oni is more active, interacting with objects more often, when there are people nearby
        ●When performing a ghost event, the Oni:
            ●Cannot perform the "airball" event, which involves a physical ball of fog moving towards the player, usually disappearing with a hiss sound upon collision. Note that chasing events can similarly cause a hiss
            ●Will prefer showing in its full form during a manifestation event as opposed to a shadowy or translucent form
            ●Will have double the sanity drain of other ghosts when colliding with the target player in a ghost event (so 20% instead of 10%)
        ●On certain maps (specifically 13 Willow Street, Prison, and rarely Maple Lodge Campsite), a large ball of mist may fly rapidly across the map in one direction and through walls. This is different from the airball event and itself does not count as a ghost event. Regardless, if the ghost is an Oni, this mist will also never appear
        ●During a hunt, the Oni flickers and is on average invisible for shorter and visible for longer compared to most other ghosts

        ●With increased activity in general, the Oni may more readily give up evidence to players, which can make for generous and swift investigations if an Oni is quick to reveal the necessary evidence
        ●Since the Oni cannot perform the airball ghost event, an Oni can be ruled out if the ghost performs such an event. It must be emphasised that the Oni can hiss as part of a chasing event. A way to differentiate the chasing event is that you will hear the (random) ghost vocalisation and footsteps, and doors in the room will usually close (if any). Also, there are four hiss sounds that an airball event cannot do; only one hiss sound is shared by airball and chasing events
        ●While not a particularly aggressive ghost, as the Oni is more likely to trigger ghost events against hunters, it may more rapidly bring the team down to hunt sanity threshold, especially when factoring in its doubled sanity reduction when colliding with players during ghost events. Depending on the circumstances, Sanity Medication can be used to counteract this loss, or defensive items like Incense can be brought in sooner

    Info On Ghost:
        Strength
            ●Chance to hunt at any sanity after blowing out a flame
            ●Blows out fiery objects (candles, campfire) more often with more dead people
        Weakness(es)
            ●Presence of flames prevents the ghost from hunting

        ●If a player is currently dead, the Onryo will blow out sources of flame (lit firelight, igniter, or campfire) at a higher frequency. More dead players increases this frequency. It will blow out flames at the same frequency as other ghosts if no players are dead. The Onryo may appear to more frequently blow out flames below 60% average sanity, but this is because of its hunt attempts rather than an actual increased chance to interact with them
        ●Contrary to the journal, flames do not make the Onryo more likely to leave a room
        ●Counterintuitively, flames can both prevent hunts and cause a hunt:
            ●If the Onryo attempts a hunt within 4[2] metres of any type of flame, it will blow out the flame instead, and the hunt will fail. This does not restart the hunt cooldown timer, unlike a crucifix. If both a crucifix and a flame are within range, the flame will take priority over the crucifix for preventing the hunt
            ●Every third flame that the Onryo blows out will cause it to attempt to initiate a hunt, regardless of current average sanity. This hunt can be blocked by normal prevention methods (e.g. a crucifix) or another flame
                ●Note that there can be a delay of up to 6 seconds before the hunt actually initiates
                ●A flame preventing a hunt or blown out during a hunt will count towards the three-flame rule
                ●Whether it was the same item being blown out does not matter; it can be the same firelight blown out 3 times, 3 firelights each blown out 1 time, or any other combination
                ●If the third flame is blown out during a hunt or an Incense's cleansing effect, the hunt attempt will be canceled. However, if the third flame is blown out during a hunt cooldown, the Onryo will use its ability at the end of the cooldown
        ●Consequently, there are several situations (non-exhaustive) which might occur:
            ●One firelight and one crucifix is within range of the Onryo, and it blows out the firelight as its third flame. The ability is triggered, but the crucifix will prevent the hunt, losing one charge
            ●One firelight and one lit igniter is within range of the Onryo, and it blows out the firelight as the third flame. The igniter will prevent the hunt and be blown out
            ●One firelight is within range of the Onryo, and it attempts to hunt naturally. The firelight prevents the hunt and is blown out
        ●Onryos have a hunt sanity threshold of 60%, compared to the standard 50% baseline

        ●The Onryo's aversion to fire, while a powerful tool against it, does come with risks of its own. However, with sufficient firelights and diligent relighting of them whenever they're extinguished, the Onryo may be kept from hunting indefinitely, which may also serve as identification for the ghost on reduced evidences difficulties. On the other hand, only having one lit firelight within range of it increases the risk of it hunting as a result of blowing it out if said firelight is being re-lit, or other flame sources are being activated nearby. The latter is even riskier if one or more players have died, as the Onryo will blow out firelights in increasing frequency. Players should consider whether having flames lit near the ghost is worth it to prevent hunts, or if they should be disregarded outright and simply play around the Onryo's heightened hunt threshold
        Identification
            ●The Onryo can be tested using several ways, by looking for flame priority, preventing hunts with flames, or the three-flame rule:
                ●Place one crucifix in the ghost's area, then a firelight directly on top
                    ●Note that this is less reliable with Tier II or III crucifixes as they have a range that is greater than or equal to the flame range
                ●Place two crucifixes in the ghost's area, then multiple firelights spread out and covering the crucifixes' ranges
            ●When sanity is deemed low enough, keep the firelights lit in a timely manner
                ●If the crucifix is activated without the firelights going out first, then it is not an Onryo
                ●If the ghost seems to not hunt with multiple firelights active, or hunts in an area where no firelights are lit, then it may be an Onryo
            ●The third method is to keep track of the number of flames the ghost blows out, and observe whether the ghost tries to hunt every third flame. Note that igniters and the campfire on the campsites also count towards hunt prevention and starting the ability hunt
            ●In Sunny Meadows, several lit candles can be found in the chapel, which ghosts can blow out. If the ghost is located there and hunts very early (and is otherwise not a Demon), then it may be an Onryo
            ●The Onryo is one of two ghosts (the other being the Hantu) for which you can collect all three pieces of evidence without excluding The Mimic. Therefore, before concluding you're dealing with an Onryo, check whether the ghost leaves Ultraviolet evidence. If it does, you have The Mimic instead

        ●If the photo is taken while the Phantom is in a D.O.T.S state, it will also physically disappear
        ●If the photo is taken during a hunt, the Phantom will also be invisible in the photo, but it will continue to physically flash in and out, and the hunt will not be affected in any way
        ●The Phantom has an ability where it will choose a random player and travel to their location (as opposed to a regular roam).[1] This will create an EMF Level 2 reading at the location where the roam ended. This behavior is somewhat similar to that of the Banshee and the Wraith; unlike Banshees, Phantoms do not select a player to target until they die or leave the game, and do not do this as often; and unlike Wraiths, the Phantom physically walks to that point rather than teleporting, and will set off Motion Sensors and disturb Salt on the way to it
        ●Being within 10 metres of a Phantom while in pseudo line-of-sight (where heartbeats play) reduces the player's sanity by 0.5%/s. This only applies during ghost events and hunts, and is separate from passive sanity drain. This does not apply during ghost events if the Phantom was made invisible by taking a picture
        ●During a hunt, the Phantom flickers and is on average visible for shorter and invisible for longer compared to most other ghosts

        Identification
            ●A good way to identify a Phantom is to observe whether the ghost is invisible for longer intervals on average during hunts (more than 1 second); this will usually indicate a Phantom
            ●Taking a photo of a Phantom during a ghost event is also a fair indicator. The main identifier is the ghost disappearing from view, but its vocalizations can still be heard. Additionally, the Phantom will not be visible in the photo, and there will be no interference pattern on the photo
                ●Note that occasionally, desync may cause the same effect if the picture is taken right at the end of the ghost event, even if the ghost is not a Phantom. This may make this semi-unreliable; checking with other players about whether the photo is completely clear may help you to arrive at a conclusion (though it is not definite)
                ●This could also happen at the very end of a hunt
                ●This is better to do with a Summoning Circle or Music Box, since the "ghost event grace period" is generally fixed or predictable
                ●Taking photos of any ghost from a different floor will not produce interference, though for all other ghosts the ghost will still be visible
                ●Taking a photo of a Goryo during its D.O.T.S state will also produce no interference, and the ghost to be invisible on the picture
            ●The Phantom's sanity-draining ability could be used to identify it, though this is rarely the main strategy used, as its sanity drain is gradual and not as dramatic as e.g. a Moroi or Jinn's sanity drain, and the player must discern normal sanity drain due to darkness/other factors, from the actual sanity drain caused by a Phantom
            ●If activity (interactions or hunts) is noted in a room far away from its existing favourite room, and a player has recently been in that far-away room, then the ghosts could be narrowed down to a few ghosts, one of these being the Phantom. Note that some ghost events or custom difficulty settings make it normal for any ghost to move far away in this manner. On the other hand, this is more reliable on big maps, since ghost activity for a generic ghost is more likely to be confined to a small area relative to the map size
        Survival
            ●Since the Phantom is visible much less frequently during hunts, it will be harder to track, and players may die as a result of not knowing exactly where it is in time. Specifically, it will be much harder (and not recommended) to loop the ghost, while blinding it using Incense must be treated with caution: stand at the end of a suitably long hallway, and smudge slightly earlier than one would normally do to avoid being caught off guard. Tracking the ghost by its hunting noises is also a considerable strategy when dealing with a Phantom

    Info On Ghost:
        Strength
            ●Sanity decrease stacks up during multithrow interactions
        Abilities
            ●Can throw multiple objects at once
            ●Can throw a single object farther than other types
        Weakness(es)
            ●Ineffective in empty rooms with no throwables

        ●In general, the Poltergeist is more likely to throw items. During a hunt, the Poltergeist will always throw an item every 0.5 seconds, instead of only having a 50% chance to do so
        ●Occasionally, the Poltergeist will throw an item with a "force" value of 2 - 6, instead of 1 - 3 with other ghosts
        ●The Poltergeist will occasionally use an ability that allows it to throw multiple nearby items at once, creating an EMF level 2 reading (the thrown items themselves generate EMF 3). This will decrease the sanity of all nearby players in line-of-sight with the EMF 2 location by 2% per item thrown. The Poltergeist can use this ability even while the lights in its current room are on
        ●If there are no items near a Poltergeist, it is unable to use its ability. This does not influence its behaviour towards initiating a hunt

        ●Taking advantage of the Poltergeist's abilities, one can scatter multiple objects around in its room. If one object is seen being flung with force across the room, or multiple objects are thrown at once, then it is probably a Poltergeist. Note that there is some overlap of how hard regular ghosts can throw and how hard a Poltergeist can throw; this trait is harder to discern in small rooms
            ●It is generally better to build multiple small piles spread out rather than one large pile; if the Poltergeist is not near the pile, it will not affect the pile at all
        ●It's important to be prudent when suspecting a Poltergeist, and not simply immediately guess it from inconclusive behavior; while it is generally quite active in regards to constantly throwing items, the largely random nature of interactions can cause other ghosts to toss items frequently, matching the activity levels of the Poltergeist at times, especially with more active ghost types like the Oni and Thaye. Likewise, low activity should also not discount the possibility of a Poltergeist
            ●Remember to turn off the lights to increase activity
        ●The Poltergeist can also be identified during a hunt. By scattering multiple objects in the investigation area, one can witness the ghost's throwing strength and frequency. Witnessing a throw every 0.5 seconds may indicate a Poltergeist, and it will also throw items with a much stronger force, usually throwing items at high speeds across entire rooms or even between rooms

    Info On Ghost:
        Strength
            ●Active electronics boost its speed during hunts
        Weakness(es)
            ●Disrupts electronics from further away when manifesting

        ●When a Raiju manifests during a ghost event or a hunt, it will interfere with electronics that are up to 15 metres away on the same floor, instead of the usual 10 metres. This also applies to global chat
        ●When at least one piece of active electronic equipment is nearby, the Raiju's hunt sanity threshold is increased to 65%. Otherwise, it has the normal threshold of 50%
        ●During hunts, if the Raiju is within a certain distance of at least one piece of active electronic equipment, it will move at a fixed speed of 2.5 m/s:
            ●Small map: 6m
            ●Medium map: 8m
            ●Large map: 10m
        ●This also applies for items outside the investigation area, but not for items across floors
        ●Otherwise, it will follow standard ghost speeds with one particularity: if the Raiju has line-of-sight with a player near electronic equipment, the speed increase from continuous line-of-sight adds in the background, and will only be applied once it is no longer near any electronics
        ●All effects listed above apply to most electronic equipment, both when held in the hand and items dropped on the floor. The following do not count towards the speed boost or the hunt sanity threshold:
            ●Global chat
            ●Video cameras and Photo Cameras that are thrown on the ground
            ●Motion sensors, sound sensors, and D.O.T.S. Projectors that are thrown on the ground or held (excluding T1 D.O.T.S., which also needs to be turned off)
            ●Objects in the inventory (except flashlights that are turned on)
            ●Any other electrical equipment not brought in from the truck (building lights, fuse box, CCTV, fans, etc.)

        ●In order to mitigate the risk of an early hunt, it is best to turn off and/or remove any unneeded electronic equipment from the ghost room; this also prevents the Raiju from harnessing this equipment to empower itself while hunting. Lazily discarding such equipment is a surefire way to make a Raiju extremely dangerous. Additionally, players often have the reflex of discarding electronic items behind them when a hunt starts to not attract the ghost's attention to them; this should be avoided with Raijus to not leave a trail of electronic equipment to power its speed ability. Instead, players should either switch to a non-electronic item or an electronic item that can be turned off
        ●The Raiju may be readily-identified by being mindful of its speed during a hunt, particularly on small maps, so long as there are active electronic items nearby. If the ghost suddenly and significantly speeds up when roaming (and not chasing particular players), then it is most likely a Raiju; A safe way to check for this is to turn off all other nearby active electronics, drop an active electronic in the player's hiding spot, and during a hunt, check if the ghost's footsteps suddenly speed up when nearby

    Info On Ghost:
        Strength
            ●Significant speed increase when chasing a player during hunts
        Weakness(es)
            ●Roaming speed remains low or drops over time when no player is detected

        ●Revenants have very noticeable speed change between roaming and chasing modes. When a Revenant is roaming, it will move at 1 m/s. However, as soon as it detects a player (either visually or through speech/electronics), it will begin to move at 3 m/s (nearly twice the base speed of most other ghosts) and sustains this speed until it reaches the spot where it last detected a player. If and when reverting to roaming mode, the Revenant's speed will slowly decrease over ~2.7 seconds (deceleration rate of 0.75 m/s²) back to its initial value of 1 m/s
        ●Contrary to most other ghosts, the Revenant will not speed up with continuous line-of-sight

        ●Due to the Revenant's power, it is critical to hide as soon as possible and the player must exercise extreme caution as to not give away their position during a hunt. A player will not be able to outrun a Revenant for long before it catches up to them. If you are caught running from a Revenant, items such as tier III Salt or Incense can slow it/ward it off for a few seconds, giving you enough time to create some distance between you and the ghost to hide from it. Tier III Sanity Medication is also a possibility, with the infinite sprint allowing you to match the Revenant's speed for 10 seconds to potentially run to safety
        ●While hiding, listen for the ghost's footsteps; if the footsteps are relatively few and far between while the ghost is nearby, then it is most likely a Revenant. On multiplayer, the Revenant will perform an immediate area search just like any other ghost during hunts. However, it will take a longer time due to its slow movement speed while roaming, so wary players can easily identify it

    Info On Ghost:
        Strength
            ●Harder to find due to it being generally less active
        Abilities
            ●Produces hissing and shadowy form ghost events more often
        Weakness(es)
            ●Has a low hunt sanity threshold
            ●Generally unwilling to hunt and perform interactions in the presence of players

        ●On average, the Shade is less likely to perform interactions than other ghosts
        ●The Shade is less likely to perform ghost events at high sanity. At 100% average sanity, it has a 0% chance of successfully performing an event. This success rate increases by 2% per percentage of average sanity lost; at an average sanity of 50%, an attempted ghost event will always succeed
        ●When it performs a ghost event, the Shade has a higher chance of appearing as a shadow. If the ghost is made to appear using a Summoning Circle, a Music Box, or a Monkey Paw, it has a chance of appearing as a black shadow rather than in its full form while in the ghost event stage. It will return to a fully visible form when the hunt begins
        ●If at least one[1] person is in the same room as a Shade, it will be unable to perform interactions or ghost events, or initiate hunts, regardless of average sanity.[2][3] It may still perform these actions if it happens to wander into a room without players. Since interactions occur in a range, the Shade can still "reach" into the player's room from another room to interact with objects
        ●The Shade can only hunt below an average sanity of 35%, lower than most other ghosts

        ●Due to the Shade's aforementioned shyness, the lack of interactions may give it away, or players may become frustrated at the ghost not producing evidence, though this also makes them one of the safer ghosts to encounter, as their shyness also extends to hunts. Try keeping everyone out of the ghost room, as well as using Incense or specific cursed possessions that will increase the chance of the ghost interacting with the environment. Turning off the lights in the ghost's room may also help
        ●Given the Shade's inability to hunt in a room with players, one can be tested for in Nightmare/Insanity difficulty simply by lowering the average sanity close to zero, and having players stand in the ghost's current room and rooms directly adjacent. If it refuses to hunt or hunts only from a room without players, then it may be a Shade; players should identify nearby escape routes and/or prepare Incense before testing this, as the ghost may hunt in the same room as a player if it's actually not a Shade, which can be very dangerous, especially since a Shade will share two evidence types with a Jinn which is extremely difficult to escape from if the fuse box is on, and a Revenant which is almost certain death if it hunts in the same room as a player
        ●In singleplayer on Nightmare or Insanity difficulty, one way to identify a Shade is to drop the average sanity to zero, before using two Sanity Medications to restore the player's sanity to 50%, then allowing a small drop of sanity for a few seconds within the investigation area before stopping it via room lights (ideally hiding far away or on a different floor to prevent witnessing ghost events that may drain sanity). A ghost that refuses to hunt at this sanity may indicate that the ghost is a Shade
        ●If trying to identify a Shade by its hunt sanity threshold, keep in mind a Deogen and aged Thaye will also have low hunting sanity thresholds, though a Deogen is extremely easily distinguishable from its hunting behavior, and a Thaye will initially have a much higher sanity threshold, and be very active in stark contrast to a Shade; a Mare will also have a similarly low sanity threshold when the lights in its ghost room are on; turn it off to raise its sanity threshold and prevent mistaking it for a Shade
        ●The Shade appearing as a shadow when manifested by cursed possessions is not guaranteed, so seeing a full-body manifestation with them does not rule out a Shade

    Info On Ghost:
        Weakness(es)
            ●Incense prevents hunts for longer (double duration)
        
        ●When Incense is used near a Spirit, it will not be able to initiate a hunt for 180 seconds instead of 90 seconds with most other ghosts. Like other ghosts, this will not prevent cursed hunts. This delay will also apply if the Spirit was smudged during a hunt
        ●Spirits have no other special behaviour

        ●With no special powers, and a harsher reaction to Incense, Spirits serve as a baseline to measure other ghosts against. With their behavior not being especially unique amongst the ghosts, its overall lack of defining traits can confuse investigators; therefore, unless clear evidence is established, a Spirit can be easily mistaken for another entity
        ●The main (and usually only) way to test for a Spirit without using evidence is to lower the average sanity to below 50%, and smudge the ghost while it is hunting; if it hunts again before the three minutes is up, it is not a Spirit. If it hunts only after three minutes, it is very likely (though not conclusively) a Spirit. Note that if it hunts within the first minute of the smudge stick being used, then the smudge stick did not work, and the player should attempt to smudge it again. In Nightmare/Insanity difficulty, players should wait for a hunt or a burnt crucifix to confirm that the average sanity is low enough
        ●A more reliable way to test for Spirit is using incense near the ghost, start a timer and wait for around 160 seconds and then use incense near the ghost again. Using motion sensors can be helpful to determine the position of the ghost. If the ghost hunts within the next 60 seconds of the second incensing (and the ghost was actually hit by both incenses), the ghost is a Spirit. The reason for this is that if another incense is being used while another incense effect is going on, the cleansing effect of the second incense will not be applied

        Strength
            ●Becomes very active the first time a player gets nearby
        Weakness(es)
            ●The more time players spend near it, the quieter and slower it becomes

        ●The Thaye has an internal "age" parameter that affects its general activity. Every 1 to 2 minutes, the Thaye attempts to age; if at least one player is in the same room as the ghost, the Thaye will add 1 to its age, else it will re-attempt to age every 30 seconds until success. The cycle then repeats. If the Thaye successfully uses this ability during a hunt, the age increase will only be effective after the hunt.[1] The following shows the parameters that are affected by age:
            ●Behaviour: Age 0 (Initial), Per age added, Age 10 and higher
            ●Hunt sanity threshold: 75%, -6%, 15%
            ●Hunt speed: 2.75 m/s, -0.175 m/s, 1 m/s
            ●Relative interaction/ghost event rate: 200%, -15%, 50%
        ●Further ageing after 10 does not further affect its activity
        ●For every age added, the Thaye's "human age" as provided by the Ouija Board increases by 1 - 4. Unlike ghost activity, there is no (reasonably attainable) limit on the Thaye's "human age". The Thaye's starting "human age" can still be anywhere from 10 - 90, like all other ghosts
        ●Unlike most other ghosts, the Thaye does not speed up with line-of-sight of a player

        ●With a Thaye, both interactions and events will be more frequent from the start of the investigation, which may make it easier to locate the ghost. On the other hand, if players do not locate the ghost quickly, especially on large maps, the Thaye may prove to be one of the most dangerous ghosts in the game, as its initial hunt sanity threshold is higher than that of a Demon's, and it is much faster when chasing players during these early hunts. Due to the extreme danger it can pose towards the beginning of a contract, identifying hiding spot locations as soon as possible is very prudent
        ●Once the ghost has been located, setting up ghost writing books and D.O.T.S Projectors to try and get their evidences early may help, especially on Nightmare where one evidence is hidden; if the ghost gives both Ghost Writing and D.O.T.S Projector, then it is guaranteed to be a Thaye, as the Deogen (the only other ghost to share those two evidence types with it) has guaranteed Spirit Box as one of its pieces of evidence
        ●One could identify a Thaye through its hunting behaviour; if it is fast early in the contract, slows down over several hunts as players continue spending time near it, and does not gain speed with line-of-sight, then a Thaye is likely. Likewise, if the ghost hunts early and has high levels of activity, but becomes less willing to hunt, interact, or perform ghost events over time, this could also point to a Thaye
        ●Because ghost events and interactions are more common early on, one should use this opportunity to complete any non-hunt related objectives or fill the journal with photos. Taking the hunt sanity threshold into consideration, if one is careful with how they interact with the ghost, a (near-)perfect contract can be achieved easily. However, if players spend excessive time in the ghost room and cause the Thaye to age quickly, and are not careful with their cursed possession usage to compensate for the loss in activity, completing objectives and obtaining photo evidence could become an annoying (or boring) task
        ●Hunt-related objectives on the other hand are best left for when the ghost has aged enough that it is no longer a major threat; after aging 4 times, a Thaye will be slower than the player's average speed if continuously sprinting off-cooldown, and after aging 3 more times (for 7 times in total), it will be slower than the player's walking speed, allowing them to be easily looped. Staying in the ghost room for a period of time to age them to safe levels, then using a cursed possession to force a hunt is a safe way of completing many objectives such as escaping the ghost during a hunt

    Info On Ghost:
        Strength
            ●Mimics other ghost types one after another for brief periods of time
        Weakness(es)
            ●Will always produce false ghost orbs

        ●The Mimic is able to imitate any type of ghost, and inherit all of its features and abilities:
            ●Interaction and ghost event rates and preferences
            ●Hunt thresholds
            ●Hunt movement speeds
            ●Various forms of special abilities (e.g. Poltergeist multithrow, Demon ability hunt)
        ●When imitating a type of ghost, The Mimic will not copy its types of evidence, and will not necessarily provide its guaranteed type of evidence on reduced-evidence difficulties such as Insanity, but can copy features related to evidence. For example, it is able to copy the Obake's six-fingered handprints or the Deogen's breathing, as The Mimic has Ultraviolet and Spirit Box as evidence, but it cannot copy the Goryo's trait of only appearing on a Video Camera when interacting with a D.O.T.S Projector, as The Mimic does not have D.O.T.S Projector as one of its types of evidence
        ●The Mimic will change the ghost type that it chooses to imitate every 30 seconds to 2 minutes, but cannot change during hunts
        ●If The Mimic imitates a Thaye, a fixed age between 0 and 10 is randomly selected, and it will imitate another ghost using its own timer instead of the Thaye's ageing timer
        ●Aside from the 23 other ghost types that The Mimic can imitate, it can also mimic a "blank" state (in which it essentially mimics itself). When this is the case, it will act as a default ghost and have no special abilities. The Mimic will always start in this "blank" state at the beginning of each contract before changing after a random amount of time
        ●The Mimic provides "evidence" of Ghost Orbs in addition to its three main evidence types, which also appear on difficulties with reduced evidence, including zero evidence. These Ghost Orbs, along with the other types of evidence if none are hidden due to the difficulty, will always exist regardless of the type of ghost that The Mimic chooses to imitate, and will behave in exactly the same way as those produced by other ghost types and will only levitate in the ghost room

        ●The Mimic's fundamental nature means that it is unpredictable: it can theoretically have the powers of almost any ghost type at any time, most notably ghost abilities that could enable early hunts. The absolute safest way to handle a Mimic is to treat it as if it had every potential modifier that could increase its aggression, and make sure to utilize if not all, then at least a few tactics that would be used to dissuade attacks from other ghost types:
            ●Try to minimize speaking when near the ghost (Yokai)
            ●Turn off electronics that are no longer needed (Raiju)
            ●Make sure to have active sources of flame in the Ghost Room (Onryo)
            ●In general, be prepared for the possibility of early hunts (Demon)
        ●Additionally, it is prudent to have Incense handy, as The Mimic may imitate fast ghosts such as the Revenant or Thaye, or most dangerously imitate the Deogen and require hunters to completely change up their strategy from hiding to looping between hunts, potentially after everyone is already situated at a hiding spot
        ●The presence of Ghost Orbs with The Mimic means that players have to take care when trying to identify the ghost with three types of evidence, including Ghost Orbs, if there is a potential overlap between The Mimic and another ghost. In particular, players have to be careful if a Hantu/Onryo is identified through evidence; Identifying Ultraviolet, Ghost Orbs, and Freezing Temperatures usually indicates a Hantu, but as The Mimic creates orbs, Spirit Box evidence has to be definitively ruled out before a Hantu can be confirmed; similarly, identifying Spirit Box, Ghost Orbs, and Freezing Temperatures can lead to a mistaken identification of the ghost as an Onryo if the Mimic's Ultraviolet go undiscovered. Players should go further in confirming or eliminating the presence of a fourth type of evidence for these two ghost types
        ●On reduced-evidence difficulties, however, this can cause The Mimic to be very simple to identify, as The Mimic always produces these orbs, and will appear to go over the set maximum amount of given types of evidence. On difficulties with three evidence, identifying Ultraviolet, Spirit Box and Ghost Orbs also definitively indicates a Mimic, as no other ghost has this evidence combination
        ●Concerning evidence, if the player notices behavior that normally points to a specific ghost type, but getting types of evidence that they do not have, can bring The Mimic into suspicion, allowing for more focused evidence-gathering, or even give away its identity outright. For example, if the player hears a Banshee's distinctive scream on the Parabolic Microphone, but also gets a Spirit Box response which Banshees do not have, then it's guaranteed to be a Mimic

    Info On Ghost:
        Strength
            ●Can hunt from a different place than expected
        Abilities
            ●Differing speeds depending on which twin hunts
        Weakness(es)
            ●Can interact with the environment simultaneously

        ●Despite its name and accompanying flavor text, mechanically, The Twins is simply one ghost. This means there is no "decoy twin" to:
            ●Set off motion sensors
            ●Produce evidence of Freezing Temperatures (or even affect temperatures to begin with) or Spirit Box
            ●Perform ghost events or hunts at the same time
        ●When The Twins uses its ability, it will perform one interaction in the normal radius (up to 1.5 metres on small maps, and up to 3 metres on medium and large maps) and one within a larger radius (up to 8 metres on small maps, and up to 16 metres on medium and large maps). All such interactions follow the standard 25% chance of producing EMF 5 instead of 2 or 3, regardless of which radius was used to perform the interaction
        ●When The Twins attempts to initiate a hunt, there is a 50% chance for it begin at its current location, and a 50% chance for it to begin close to the area where it last interacted with the large radius. Regardless of where The Twins hunts from, it will follow standard hunting rules. As The Twins is only one ghost, two hunts cannot occur simultaneously, and it will follow the standard 25-second cooldown between hunts
        ●Depending on where the hunt begins from, The Twins will move at two different speeds. If it hunts from its present location, it will have a base speed of 1.53 m/s, and if it hunts from the area where its large radius interaction occurred, it will have a base speed of 1.87 m/s
        ●When The Twins attempts to hunt, the crucifix check will be applied at the ghost's current location. If The Twins decides to start its hunt at the site of its last large radius interaction, it will teleport to that location after the crucifix check

        ●The Twins' primary strength is its ability to misdirect: its core ability can very easily conjure red herring interactions at parts of the map far from the favourite room where it would give evidence, misleading hunters and delaying their efforts to identify it. This can be especially troublesome on larger maps like Sunny Meadows Mental Institution when trying to locate the favourite room. However, these misleading interactions can be used against it: as the ghost is not physically in the room where these long-ranged interactions occur, evidence past EMF Level 5 cannot be obtained in the area. Using a thermometer and noting a lack of Freezing Temperatures (or, at the very least, notable temperature drops) where ghost activity is noted, or failing to receive Spirit Box responses in rooms near where interactions occurred, are strong signs of the antics of The Twins trying to cause trouble
        ●Noticing a subtle change in base speed from one hunt to another might indicate that the player is dealing with The Twins. Be sure to avoid confounding factors such as line-of-sight acceleration, or a few other ghosts which may also change base speeds between hunts
        ●Due to The Twins having two possibilities in regards to angles of attack for any given hunt, it is recommended to plan for the event that The Twins approaches from a planned escape route, such as through use of Incense. Additionally, as The Twins checks for a crucifix in its current location before teleporting to the location of its last large radius interaction if it decides to be fast during the hunt, this can lead the ghost to begin a hunt directly on top of a crucifix, something no other ghost can do (outside of a cursed hunt)

    Info On Ghost:
        Abilities
            ●Can teleport to a random player, becoming active near them, outside of ghost events and hunts
        Weakness(es)
            ●Never steps in salt

        ●The Wraith will never step in a salt pile, and therefore will never disturb them. This includes Tier III Salt during hunts, rendering it ineffective against one
        ●When the Wraith is not hunting, it has a chance to teleport to a random player, generating an EMF Level 2 reading at the location where it teleported to, with a 25% chance for this to be an EMF Level 5 reading instead. The Wraith will resume normal behaviour after teleporting
        ●Wraiths cannot and do not:
            ●Float off the ground, whether during hunts or manifestations. A Wraith cannot be identified by looking at its ghost model
            ●See through physical objects such as walls and doors
            ●Walk quietly; Wraiths will emit footstep noises at the same volume as most other ghosts
            ●Walk through walls, even during hunts; they can only walk through doors (which all other ghosts are also able to do)

        Identification
            Salt test
                ●The Wraith will never step in or disturb a salt pile. If you've had undisturbed salt in the ghost's room for a prolonged period of time, then it could be a Wraith. This can be used to identify a Wraith deterministically: either during a fake hunt ghost event or during a real hunt, place salt in front of where the ghost is about to step. If it does not disturb the salt pile despite passing directly through it, then it is a Wraith
                ●Placing salt in the center of the Summoning Circle and then summoning the ghost is a good way to spot a Wraith
                ●Alternatively, one could place a line of salt across a tight access route where the ghost is highly likely to pass through (e.g. a doorway for/in the ghost's room), then place a motion sensor or two on the doorway. If the ghost passes through the motion sensor(s) but never steps in the salt, then it is likely a Wraith. Note that the salt should be tightly packed enough (but not wasteful) such that a ghost that passes through is otherwise virtually guaranteed to step on the salt. Tier II or tier III salt makes this work easier since they are placed in a long pile
            Teleportation
                ●The Wraith's teleporting behaviour may give rise to otherwise odd behaviour, such as:
                    ●Interactions happening far away from the favourite room and near where a player currently is (or recently was)
                    ●Seemingly random EMF level 2 or 5 readings which could not have been caused by any interaction, especially far away from the favourite room
                ●The Banshee and Phantom can also roam/walk (but not teleport) to a player, while The Twins can interact with objects far away, and of these other culprits only the Phantom can create these apparently random EMF readings when moving to a player. Meanwhile, having the roaming frequency setting on Medium or High may induce similar behaviour. If desired, one could use motion sensors to see where the ghost actually is (moving) when it performs such an interaction
        Hunt
            ●Although the Wraith teleporting does not by itself trigger a chance to hunt, it could possibly hunt from the location it teleported to if it meets normal hunt requirements. This makes being almost anywhere within the investigation area dangerous once average sanity is low enough; avoid being caught off guard by the Wraith starting a hunt nearby
        Other
            ●As Wraiths leave no ultraviolet evidence and does not disturb salt at all, it may be harder to obtain photo rewards with one. Try placing props around the ghost's general location for interaction photos, or utilize a Ouija Board if one spawns. One can also use a Firelight to get interactions

    Info On Ghost:
        Strength
            ●Talking near it will temporarily increase the hunting threshold and interaction rate
        Weakness(es)
            ●When hunting, it can only hear voices and detect electronics within a short range

        ●Utilizing voice chat near the Yokai at any sanity will increase its rate of activity.
        ●When a Music Box is used, the Yokai must be closer to the box (within 2.5 metres instead of 5) for it to trigger the ghost event and eventual cursed hunt
        ●When at least one player uses voice chat in the same room as the Yokai, its hunt sanity threshold is temporarily increased to 80%. Otherwise, it has the standard threshold of 50%
        ●During hunts, a Yokai can only hear players or sense handheld active electronics that are within 2.5 meters of it. Its line-of-sight is unaffected

        ●The Yokai is identifiable through two distinctive traits: it will hunt more often when players are together and talking near it, but its ability to detect hidden players during a hunt through voice or electronics will be limited. For example, it will be less likely to follow the player past multiple line-of-sight breaks, and will not be attracted to held electronics unless the Yokai is already very close to the holder
        ●Although its 80% hunt threshold is theoretically the highest in the game, even greater than that of the Demon and the youngest Thaye, in practice, these extremely early hunts are rare. The Yokai does not have any additional buffs (and is in fact weaker) when hunting, so escaping it will be generally easier
        ●To test for a Yokai during a hunt, stand at a distance close enough to where the ghost is currently at that is outside of the ghost's immediate line of sight, preferably near a hiding spot, and then turn on an electronic device and/or begin speaking in voice chat. If the ghost does not seek out the player making this noise, especially if it causes disruption of the device and then passes by instead of homing in, then it is likely a Yokai. Note that the electronic disruption range is a little bit greater than the actual range in which most ghosts will actually sense the held device. Care should be taken to not mistake the Yokai's limited hearing and electronics detection sense with the Banshee ignoring players other than its target (if they are inside the investigation area) during a hunt, especially on Nightmare as both these ghosts share two evidence
        ●The Monkey Paw's wish to unblock a hiding spot will cause the ghost to be able to hear the speech and held electronics of the player who used it from any distance, overriding the Yokai's weakness. This may make trying to test a Yokai from its trait much more difficult, and when playing singleplayer, outright impossible
        ●In multiplayer, the Yokai becomes mildly more dangerous, as there are more players that could be talking near the Yokai at any given moment, and thus can elevate its hunt sanity threshold more often. Where possible, less experienced players should ideally keep voice communications as short as possible until the ghost room is found. Otherwise, completing objectives can be made easier by encouraging the Yokai to hunt through talking

    Hints:

    Info On Ghost:
        Abilities
            ●May randomly shut a door and deduct nearby players' sanity
        Weakness(es)
            ●Will be temporarily confined to its room after smudging

        ●When Incense is used on the Yurei, in addition to preventing hunts and temporarily increasing activity, it will return to its favourite room and be trapped within it for 90 seconds[1], stopping it from roaming through the location. It can still leave that room by performing a ghost event, but it will return to it once the event ends. If the Yurei is affected by incense during a hunt, it will only be trapped in its favourite room after the hunt ends for the remaining time of the cleansing effect
        ●Outside of its ability, the Yurei doesn't have an increased chance to interact with doors
        ●When choosing to use its ability, the Yurei will first check if its current room has an opened door. Doors that count for this ability are mostly room doors, as well as exit doors, large tent doors on campsites, Dining Room cabinet doors and Living Room/Games Room fireplace doors on Point Hope, and washing machine doors on Sunny Meadows. Hiding spot doors, however, do not count
        ●If the check is successful, the following is caused:
            ●All players within 7.5 metres of the ghost will have their sanity decreased by 15%. Players outside the investigation area will not be affected by the sanity drain
            ●The ghost will randomly select one opened door in the room and close it fully.[3] This in turn produces two EMF 2 interactions on that door
                ●All ghosts can shut a door in the same way the Yurei can, however the Yurei will do this much more frequently as it is connected to its sanity drain ability
                ●Large tent doors will not fully close

        ●Generally, keeping doors wide open near the ghost will help one to observe when the Yurei uses its ability
            ●If the ghost shuts an exit door fully without a ghost event or hunt, then it is very likely a Yurei
                ●Check for Ultraviolet evidence on the exit door; if it is present on the door, then it is a Mimic that is mimicking a Yurei, not an actual Yurei
            ●If the ghost shuts any other door fully, then it is very likely (but not definitely) a Yurei
        ●Any ghost can shut a non-exit door in the exact same manner, including the double touch and delayed shut sound effects. Some points to consider:
            ●The chance of other ghosts doing this compared to the Yurei is exceedingly low; one may not see this happen in many hours of gameplay
            ●The Yurei can perform this action without draining sanity, since it is not exclusive to the ability. However, the chance of this happening is much lower than the ability itself happening
            ●Any ghost can close doors (whether exit or non-exit) during a hunt or a ghost event; one should only look out for the identifier outside of hunts and ghost events
        ●The Yurei ability does not involve opening doors, only closing
        ●Rarely, doors can be pushed without actually grabbing them to do so. This can be mistaken for the ghost slamming the door. Use an EMF Reader to check if the ghost actually interacted with the door
        ●All this being said, it is worth noting that the Yurei's ability is not particularly common, further exacerbated if the Yurei is occupying a room with no valid doors, in which case it will simply never use it. For an alternate strategy if the Yurei refrains from using its ability, one can look out for its special interaction with Incense once its favourite room is found: use it on the ghost, then set up Salt such that the piles cover the exit/doorway to the room. If the ghost passes through the salt and exits the room within 90 seconds of it being affected by the Incense, and without having performed a ghost event to do so, then it is not a Yurei
        ●Ultimately, however, the Yurei is one of the more evidence-dependent ghost types to conclusively identify, making it particularly difficult to puzzle out on reduced evidences difficulties like Nightmare and Insanity

    Hints:
        ●The Banshee has a higher chance of performing singing ghost events over other types
        ●If all of the following Abilitiess are met:
            1)The ghost event is a singing event
            2)The ghost event is targeted towards the hunt target
            3)The hunt target causes the Banshee to disappear prematurely (by going near it)
        Then the hunt target's sanity will decrease by 15%, instead of the usual 10%
        ●Like other ghosts, who the Banshee targets for a ghost event is random and based on distance; being the hunt target by itself does not increase their chance of being the ghost event target
        ●For female ghosts, there are 2 other singing vocalizations that are not considered true singing events, hence the Banshee's sanity deduction from these is the standard 10%
        ●When in a D.O.T.S. state, the Banshee will try to move towards its hunt target instead of the nearest player
        ●The Banshee cannot change favorite rooms by itself in any difficulty. This can be overridden via the sanity wish when using the Monkey Paw
        ●When the Banshee performs a roam outside of hunts, if the hunt target is inside the investigation area, it has a 2/3 (67%) chance of triggering its ability which makes it roam to the target. The ability fails if the ghost and the hunt target are on different floors except if:
            ●)The map is Point Hope
            ●)The Banshee was in a basement or an attic for all other maps
        ●When a Parabolic Microphone is used, the Banshee has a 33% chance of making a unique shriek-like paranormal sound instead of a regular whisper
        ●At the start of the game a player is randomly selected as the hunt target. If the hunt target leaves the game or dies, a new hunt target will be selected
        ●When a Banshee hunts, it will mostly follow standard hunt rules, but it will ignore all players other than its hunt target. It will not attempt to chase other players nor will it kill them, even if it comes into direct contact with a non-target player, instead passing through them. The Banshee will react to Incense lit by other players within range, but this will not allow for completion of the "Repel a ghost while it is chasing someone" optional objective unless the Banshee is also chasing its target when this occurs
        ●If the hunt target is outside the building, the Banshee will still use its target's sanity to decide whether to hunt. However, if it does hunt, it will hunt like any other ghost, chasing any opportune player

    Hunt Abilities - Can start a hunt at any sanity
    Smudging Title - Smudging
    Smudging - 60 seconds
    Hints:
        ●The Demon has an ability that allows it to automatically start a hunt, regardless of current average sanity. There is no particular behaviour or condition (such as requiring line-of-sight with a player) that affects if it activates or not; if it decides to use its ability, it will hunt. This hunt can be blocked by normal prevention methods
        ●Because the Demon's ability hunt is governed by the "ability phase", these hunts occur much less frequently than hunts derived from being below its sanity threshold. Additionally, as this is not a "proper" hunt attempt, the Demon can technically attempt to use its ability during the setup phase on Amateur and Intermediate difficulties. However, it will fail and there will be no hunt as hunts cannot occur at all during the setup phase
        ●Demons have a minimum cooldown of 20 seconds between hunts, instead of the usual 25 seconds
        ●As a weakness, the effective range of a crucifix is 50% larger than the standard range:
            ●4.5 metres instead of 3 for Tier I
            ●6 metres instead of 4 for Tier II
            ●7.5 metres instead of 5 for Tier III

    Smudging - 90 seconds
    Hints:
        ●If the player asks any question through the Spirit Box while standing within 1 metre of the Deogen, it has a 33% chance with each question to produce a unique response of constant heavy bull-like breathing, instead of a regular response
        ●During a hunt, the Deogen always has line-of-sight with all players on the map; in other words, it does not use the "roaming" mechanic. When the hunt begins, the Deogen will pick the nearest player (by straight-line distance) to move towards. It will occasionally "refresh" and repick the nearest target throughout the hunt. One can also use Incense to stun the Deogen temporarily and force it to change its target when the smudge effect runs out
        ●When the Deogen is chasing a player, its speed is based on its pathfinding distance to the target player and has three thresholds: above 6 meters, between 6 and 2.5 meters and below 2.5 meters
            ●> 6m: 3 m/s
            ●Between 2.5 - 6m: Assumed speed gradient between 0.4 - 3 m/s
            ●< 2.5m: 0.4 m/s
        ●If the Deogen is smudged or is otherwise not chasing any player, its speed will remain at its current speed, or 1.6 m/s if its current speed is greater than 3 m/s. Otherwise, the Deogen does not alter its speed based on line-of-sight while chasing a player
        ●During a hunt, the Deogen flickers and is on average invisible for shorter and visible for longer compared to most other ghosts

        ●The Goryo will not leave its favourite room as often as other ghosts and cannot change favourite rooms by itself in any difficulty. This can be overridden via the sanity wish when using the Monkey Paw
        ●The Goryo will only enter in a D.O.T.S state if no players are in the same room as the ghost. In addition, its D.O.T.S silhouette is only visible through a Video Camera, and cannot be seen with the naked eye. A Goryo will still manifest normally during ghost events and hunts with its ghost model, which does not require any special equipment to be seen

    Hints:
        ●The Hantu cannot turn on the fuse box, and is twice as likely to turn it off
        ●During a hunt, the Hantu's speed is affected by the temperature of the room that it goes through:
          ●Room temperature - Ghost speed (m/s)
          ●> 15°C (59°F) - 1.4
          ●12–15°C (53.6–59°F) - 1.75
          ●9–12°C (48.2–53.6°F) - 2.1
          ●6–9°C (42.8–48.2°F) - 2.3
          ●3–6°C (37.4–42.8°F) - 2.4
          ●0–3°C (32–37.4°F) - 2.5
          ●< 0°C (32°F) - 2.7
        ●Unlike most other ghosts, the Hantu does not have line-of-sight acceleration during hunts
        ●During a hunt, the Hantu will emit freezing breath near its head in any room as long as the fuse box is off. Dead players cannot see this breath. As this is not actual "evidence", it can appear on any difficulty

    Smudging - 90 seconds
    Hints:
        ●The Jinn cannot directly turn off the fuse box. However, it can still indirectly turn off the fuse box by turning too many lights on and overloading it
        ●There is a popular myth claiming the Jinn will interact with electronics often rather than other interactions; this is not true. The Jinn has an equal chance of interacting with anything nearby
        ●When near a player and the fuse box is on, the Jinn will occasionally use an ability that lowers the sanity of one player in the same room or otherwise within 3 meters of it by 25%. The player who will lose sanity is the first in the list (established by the order the players joined the lobby) among players in range. An EMF 2 or 5 reading will then be generated at the fuse box
        ●During a hunt, if all of the following three criteria are satisfied:
          ●The fuse box is turned on
          ●The Jinn has line-of-sight with a player it is targeting
          ●The Jinn is further than 3 metres from that player
        ●Then its speed will be fixed at 2.5 m/s while the criteria are met. Otherwise, it will obey standard ghost speeds with one particularity: while it is travelling at the fixed 2.5 m/s speed, the speed increase from continuous line-of-sight adds in the background, and will be applied once one criteria is no longer satisfied
        ●Whether there are lights turned on or not does not affect the Jinn's abilities

    Smudging Title - Smudging
    Smudging - 90 seconds
    Hints:
        ●Mares cannot interact with lights to turn them on, and they are more likely to choose turning off lights as an interaction
        ●The Mare does not have any affinity with computer monitors, televisions, and the fuse box, and can turn them on or off like most other ghosts
        ●When the Mare roams, it is more likely to choose an unlit room to roam into than a lit room, and therefore has a higher chance to change its favourite room if the current one is lit
        ●The Mare has a higher chance of performing light-shattering ghost events over other types, as this will disable the lights, making it easier to hunt
        ●If a player turns on a light that is within 4 metres of a Mare, it has a small chance of turning the light off almost immediately. Each light has a minimum cooldown per player of 10 seconds after it has been turned on or off, and interacting with the light again before the cooldown ends will restart it and cancel the Mare's attempt to use this ability. The Mare can use this ability even if the fuse box is turned off or broken, but not if the light is shattered. The ability also works during a ghost event
        ●A Mare has a modified hunt sanity threshold depending on whether the room it is currently in is lit. If the lights are turned off, the hunt sanity threshold is increased to 60%, and if the lights are turned on, the threshold is decreased to 40%. This applies even if the fuse box is turned off or broken, but not if the room's lights are destroyed. Other sources of light, such as brought-in equipment and Firelights, do not affect this threshold

    Smudging - 90 seconds
    Hints:
        ●The Moroi has an ability to "curse" a target through the following ways:
          ●By successfully obtaining a response from the Spirit Box; this will curse the person who "caused" the response, either by asking questions or triggering the failsafe
          ●By hearing whispers through the parabolic microphone
        ●When a player is cursed, their passive sanity drain is doubled, being in a lit area will no longer prevent sanity drain, and the light from Firelights will no longer mitigate against sanity loss. Walking outside of the investigation area will still pause sanity drain until they enter again. Consuming Sanity Medication removes the curse for that player. Players that have been cursed before in the contract can be cursed again. Multiple players can be cursed at the same time, but curses do not stack on a single player
        ●The Moroi's speed is dependent on the average sanity at the beginning of the hunt. The base speed increases by an average of 0.083 m/s for every 5% average sanity below its average hunt threshold of 50%. The list below shows each possible base speed for the Moroi:
          ●Average sanity % - Base ghost speed
          ●≥ 45% - 1.5 m/s
          ●40%-45% - 1.583 m/s
          ●35%-40% - 1.66 m/s
          ●30%-35% - 1.749 m/s
          ●25%-30% - 1.832 m/s
          ●20%-25% - 1.915 m/s
          ●15%-20% - 1.998 m/s
          ●10%-15% - 2.081 m/s
          ●5%-10% - 2.164 m/s
          ●0%-5% - 2.25 m/s
        ●The Moroi's speed changes during a hunt according to the current average sanity. Unlike most other ghosts with speed bonuses, the Moroi accelerates with continuous line-of-sight of a player. Below 5% average sanity, the maximum speed of a Moroi is 3.71 m/s, almost 25% faster than the Revenant's 3 m/s
        ●When using an Incense during a hunt, the duration where the Moroi cannot see nor kill players is 7.5 seconds instead of 5

    Hints:
        ●The Myling produces paranormal sounds (that can only be heard through a Parabolic Microphone) more often than other ghosts
        ●When hunting, a Myling's footstep and vocalizations sounds will only be audible to players within 12 meters – slightly greater than the range required for electronic interference – instead of the usual 20 meters. The volume of footsteps is slightly muffled near the limit, but quickly becomes discernible as it approaches

    Hunt Abilities - Can shapeshift into different model
    Smudging Title - Smudging
    Smudging - 90 seconds
    Hints:
        ●Each time the Obake interacts with a valid surface, it has a 75% chance of leaving fingerprints, instead of the usual 100%. After stepping in salt, it also has a 75% chance each step, instead of 100%, of leaving a footstep sound
        ●When creating handprints or fingerprints, there is a one-sixth (~16.7%) chance for the Obake to create a unique handprint/fingerprint pattern:
          ●A six-fingered handprint instead of the usual five fingers
          ●Two fingerprints instead of one on light switches, lamps, and TV remotes
          ●Five fingerprints instead of four on keyboards and Prison cell doors
        ●The Obake occasionally triggers an ability to reduce the remaining time for all existing fingerprints on the map by half. This ability can be triggered multiple times in quick succession, making it possible for an instance of fingerprints to last for mere seconds before vanishing
        ●When performing a fake hunt ghost event or a Music Box event, the Obake is the only ghost that will sometimes miss a footstep sound
        ●During a hunt, the Obake will occasionally shapeshift into a different ghost model of the same gender during a flicker. Dead players cannot see this shapeshift
        ●A shapeshift will always occur on the 12th, 27th, 39th, 54th, 62nd, 80th, 105th, 120th, and 132nd flickers (starting with the first flicker-in) of a hunt
          ●This means that the first shapeshift will happen approximately 7 - 9 seconds after the grace period ends
          ●This also means that the Obake will not shapeshift at all if the hunt ends prematurely (after the ghost kills a player or when all players leave the investigation area), as it will not have the time to reach the 12th flicker
        ●When shapeshifting, the Obake has an order of models it will use. The first shapeshift of the contract will always be using the first ghost model. The second shapeshift will then use the second model, the third one the third model, and so on with the list looping on itself. When the Obake reaches its own model in the list, it will shapeshift into itself with a more or less visible posture reset
        ●Both the shapeshifting and the fingerprint duration's reduction will count as an ability in the post-game statistics

    Hints:
        ●The Oni is more active, interacting with objects more often, when there are people nearby
        ●When performing a ghost event, the Oni:
          ●Cannot perform the "airball" event, which involves a physical ball of fog moving towards the player, usually disappearing with a hiss sound upon collision. Note that chasing events can similarly cause a hiss
          ●Will prefer showing in its full form during a manifestation event as opposed to a shadowy or translucent form
          ●Will have double the sanity drain of other ghosts when colliding with the target player in a ghost event (so 20% instead of 10%)
        ●On certain maps (specifically 13 Willow Street, Prison, and rarely Maple Lodge Campsite), a large ball of mist may fly rapidly across the map in one direction and through walls. This is different from the airball event and itself does not count as a ghost event. Regardless, if the ghost is an Oni, this mist will also never appear
        ●During a hunt, the Oni flickers and is on average invisible for shorter and visible for longer compared to most other ghosts

    Hunt Abilities - Can start hunt after third blown flame
    Smudging Title - Smudging
    Smudging - 90 seconds
    Hints:
        ●If a player is currently dead, the Onryo will blow out sources of flame (lit firelight, igniter, or campfire) at a higher frequency. More dead players increases this frequency. It will blow out flames at the same frequency as other ghosts if no players are dead. The Onryo may appear to more frequently blow out flames below 60% average sanity, but this is because of its hunt attempts rather than an actual increased chance to interact with them
        ●Contrary to the journal, flames do not make the Onryo more likely to leave a room
        ●Counterintuitively, flames can both prevent hunts and cause a hunt:
          ●If the Onryo attempts a hunt within 4 metres of any type of flame, it will blow out the flame instead, and the hunt will fail. This does not restart the hunt cooldown timer, unlike a crucifix. If both a crucifix and a flame are within range, the flame will take priority over the crucifix for preventing the hunt
          ●Every third flame that the Onryo blows out will cause it to attempt to initiate a hunt, regardless of current average sanity. This hunt can be blocked by normal prevention methods (e.g. a crucifix) or another flame
            ●Note that there can be a delay of up to 6 seconds before the hunt actually initiates
            ●A flame preventing a hunt or blown out during a hunt will count towards the three-flame rule
            ●Whether it was the same item being blown out does not matter; it can be the same firelight blown out 3 times, 3 firelights each blown out 1 time, or any other combination
            ●If the third flame is blown out during a hunt or an Incense's cleansing effect, the hunt attempt will be canceled. However, if the third flame is blown out during a hunt cooldown, the Onryo will use its ability at the end of the cooldown
        ●Consequently, there are several situations (non-exhaustive) which might occur:
          ●One firelight and one crucifix is within range of the Onryo, and it blows out the firelight as its third flame. The ability is triggered, but the crucifix will prevent the hunt, losing one charge
          ●One firelight and one lit igniter is within range of the Onryo, and it blows out the firelight as the third flame. The igniter will prevent the hunt and be blown out
          ●One firelight is within range of the Onryo, and it attempts to hunt naturally. The firelight prevents the hunt and is blown out

    Hints:
        ●If a successful photo is taken of a Phantom, the ghost will be invisible in the photo, and the photo will not contain any interference
        ●Furthermore, if the photo is taken during a ghost event,
          ●The ghost will physically disappear
          ●Electronic equipment will cease to malfunction
          ●Players will no longer hear their heartbeats
          ●The event sound will continue to play for the duration of the event
        ●If the photo is taken while the Phantom is in a D.O.T.S state, it will also physically disappear
        ●If the photo is taken during a hunt, the Phantom will also be invisible in the photo, but it will continue to physically flash in and out, and the hunt will not be affected in any way
        ●The Phantom has an ability where it will choose a random player and travel to their location (as opposed to a regular roam). This will create an EMF Level 2 reading at the location where the roam ended. This behavior is somewhat similar to that of the Banshee and the Wraith; unlike Banshees, Phantoms do not select a player to target until they die or leave the game, and do not do this as often; and unlike Wraiths, the Phantom physically walks to that point rather than teleporting, and will set off Motion Sensors and disturb Salt on the way to it
        ●Being within 10 metres of a Phantom while in pseudo line-of-sight (where heartbeats play) reduces the player's sanity by 0.5%/s. This only applies during ghost events and hunts, and is separate from passive sanity drain. This does not apply during ghost events if the Phantom was made invisible by taking a picture
        ●During a hunt, the Phantom flickers and is on average visible for shorter and invisible for longer compared to most other ghosts

    Hints:
        ●In general, the Poltergeist is more likely to throw items. During a hunt, the Poltergeist will always throw an item every 0.5 seconds, instead of only having a 50% chance to do so
        ●Occasionally, the Poltergeist will throw an item with a "force" value of 2 - 6, instead of 1 - 3 with other ghosts
        ●The Poltergeist will occasionally use an ability that allows it to throw multiple nearby items at once, creating an EMF level 2 reading (the thrown items themselves generate EMF 3). This will decrease the sanity of all nearby players in line-of-sight with the EMF 2 location by 2% per item thrown. The Poltergeist can use this ability even while the lights in its current room are on
        ●If there are no items near a Poltergeist, it is unable to use its ability. This does not influence its behaviour towards initiating a hunt

    Hints:
        ●When a Raiju manifests during a ghost event or a hunt, it will interfere with electronics that are up to 15 metres away on the same floor, instead of the usual 10 metres. This also applies to global chat
        ●When at least one piece of active electronic equipment is nearby, the Raiju's hunt sanity threshold is increased to 65%. Otherwise, it has the normal threshold of 50%
        ●During hunts, if the Raiju is within a certain distance of at least one piece of active electronic equipment, it will move at a fixed speed of 2.5 m/s:
          ●Small map: 6m
          ●Medium map: 8m
          ●Large map: 10m
        ●This also applies for items outside the investigation area, but not for items across floors
        ●Otherwise, it will follow standard ghost speeds with one particularity: if the Raiju has line-of-sight with a player near electronic equipment, the speed increase from continuous line-of-sight adds in the background, and will only be applied once it is no longer near any electronics
        ●All effects listed above apply to most electronic equipment, both when held in the hand and items dropped on the floor. The following do not count towards the speed boost or the hunt sanity threshold:
          ●Global chat
          ●Video cameras and Photo Cameras that are thrown on the ground
          ●Motion sensors, sound sensors, and D.O.T.S. Projectors that are thrown on the ground or held (excluding T1 D.O.T.S., which also needs to be turned off)
          ●Objects in the inventory (except flashlights that are turned on)
          ●Any other electrical equipment not brought in from the truck (building lights, fuse box, CCTV, fans, etc.)

    Smudging Title - Smudging
    Smudging - 90 seconds
    Hints:
        ●Revenants have very noticeable speed change between roaming and chasing modes. When a Revenant is roaming, it will move at 1 m/s. However, as soon as it detects a player (either visually or through speech/electronics), it will begin to move at 3 m/s (nearly twice the base speed of most other ghosts) and sustains this speed until it reaches the spot where it last detected a player. If and when reverting to roaming mode, the Revenant's speed will slowly decrease over ~2.7 seconds (deceleration rate of 0.75 m/s²) back to its initial value of 1 m/s
        ●Contrary to most other ghosts, the Revenant will not speed up with continuous line-of-sight

    Type - The Shy Lurker
    Hunt Title - Hunt

    Hunt Abilities Title - Special Abilities
    Hunt Abilities - Won't do a thing if player is near
    Smudging Title - Smudging
    Smudging - 90 seconds
    Hints:
        ●On average, the Shade is less likely to perform interactions than other ghosts
        ●The Shade is less likely to perform ghost events at high sanity. At 100% average sanity, it has a 0% chance of successfully performing an event. This success rate increases by 2% per percentage of average sanity lost; at an average sanity of 50%, an attempted ghost event will always succeed
        ●When it performs a ghost event, the Shade has a higher chance of appearing as a shadow. If the ghost is made to appear using a Summoning Circle, a Music Box, or a Monkey Paw, it has a chance of appearing as a black shadow rather than in its full form while in the ghost event stage. It will return to a fully visible form when the hunt begins
        ●If at least one person is in the same room as a Shade, it will be unable to perform interactions or ghost events, or initiate hunts, regardless of average sanity. It may still perform these actions if it happens to wander into a room without players. Since interactions occur in a range, the Shade can still "reach" into the player's room from another room to interact with objects

    Smudging Title - Smudging
    Smudging - 180 seconds
    Hints:
        ●When Incense is used near a Spirit, it will not be able to initiate a hunt for 180 seconds instead of 90 seconds with most other ghosts. Like other ghosts, this will not prevent cursed hunts. This delay will also apply if the Spirit was smudged during a hunt
        ●Spirits have no other special behaviour
        
Thaye

    Type - The Aging Spirit
    Hunt Title - Hunt Age 0 - Age 10
    Hunt - 75% - 15%
    Hunt Abilities Title - Special Abilities
    Hunt Abilities - Ages when player is in same room
    Smudging Title - Smudging
    Smudging - 90 seconds
    Hints:
        ●The Thaye has an internal "age" parameter that affects its general activity. Every 1 to 2 minutes, the Thaye attempts to age; if at least one player is in the same room as the ghost, the Thaye will add 1 to its age, else it will re-attempt to age every 30 seconds until success. The cycle then repeats. If the Thaye successfully uses this ability during a hunt, the age increase will only be effective after the hunt. The following shows the parameters that are affected by age:
          ●Behaviour: Age 0 (Initial), Per age added, Age 10 and higher
          ●Hunt sanity threshold: 75%, -6%, 15%
          ●Hunt speed: 2.75 m/s, -0.175 m/s, 1 m/s
          ●Relative interaction/ghost event rate: 200%, -15%, 50%
        ●Further ageing after 10 does not further affect its activity
        ●For every age added, the Thaye's "human age" as provided by the Ouija Board increases by 1 - 4. Unlike ghost activity, there is no (reasonably attainable) limit on the Thaye's "human age". The Thaye's starting "human age" can still be anywhere from 10 - 90, like all other ghosts
        ●Unlike most other ghosts, the Thaye does not speed up with line-of-sight of a player

    Hunt - 50%/Mimicked ghost
    Hunt Abilities Title - Special Abilities
    Hunt Abilities - Can mimic any ghost and it's abilities
    Smudging Title - Smudging
    Smudging - 90 seconds
    Hints:
        ●The Mimic is able to imitate any type of ghost, and inherit all of its features and abilities:
          ●Interaction and ghost event rates and preferences
          ●Hunt thresholds
          ●Hunt movement speeds
          ●Various forms of special abilities (e.g. Poltergeist multithrow, Demon ability hunt)
        ●When imitating a type of ghost, The Mimic will not copy its types of evidence, and will not necessarily provide its guaranteed type of evidence on reduced-evidence difficulties such as Insanity, but can copy features related to evidence. For example, it is able to copy the Obake's six-fingered handprints or the Deogen's breathing, as The Mimic has Ultraviolet and Spirit Box as evidence, but it cannot copy the Goryo's trait of only appearing on a Video Camera when interacting with a D.O.T.S Projector, as The Mimic does not have D.O.T.S Projector as one of its types of evidence
        ●The Mimic will change the ghost type that it chooses to imitate every 30 seconds to 2 minutes, but cannot change during hunts
        ●If The Mimic imitates a Thaye, a fixed age between 0 and 10 is randomly selected, and it will imitate another ghost using its own timer instead of the Thaye's ageing timer
        ●Aside from the 23 other ghost types that The Mimic can imitate, it can also mimic a "blank" state (in which it essentially mimics itself). When this is the case, it will act as a default ghost and have no special abilities. The Mimic will always start in this "blank" state at the beginning of each contract before changing after a random amount of time
        ●The Mimic provides "evidence" of Ghost Orbs in addition to its three main evidence types, which also appear on difficulties with reduced evidence, including zero evidence. These Ghost Orbs, along with the other types of evidence if none are hidden due to the difficulty, will always exist regardless of the type of ghost that The Mimic chooses to imitate, and will behave in exactly the same way as those produced by other ghost types and will only levitate in the ghost room

    Hunt Abilities Title - Special Hunt Abilities
    Hunt Abilities - Differing speeds depending on which twin hunts
    Smudging Title - Smudging
    Smudging - 90 seconds
    Hints:
        ●Despite its name and accompanying flavor text, mechanically, The Twins is simply one ghost. This means there is no "decoy twin" to:
          ●Set off motion sensors
          ●Produce evidence of Freezing Temperatures (or even affect temperatures to begin with) or Spirit Box
          ●Perform ghost events or hunts at the same time
        ●When The Twins uses its ability, it will perform one interaction in the normal radius (up to 1.5 metres on small maps, and up to 3 metres on medium and large maps) and one within a larger radius (up to 8 metres on small maps, and up to 16 metres on medium and large maps). All such interactions follow the standard 25% chance of producing EMF 5 instead of 2 or 3, regardless of which radius was used to perform the interaction
        ●When The Twins attempts to initiate a hunt, there is a 50% chance for it begin at its current location, and a 50% chance for it to begin close to the area where it last interacted with the large radius. Regardless of where The Twins hunts from, it will follow standard hunting rules. As The Twins is only one ghost, two hunts cannot occur simultaneously, and it will follow the standard 25-second cooldown between hunts
        ●Depending on where the hunt begins from, The Twins will move at two different speeds. If it hunts from its present location, it will have a base speed of 1.53 m/s, and if it hunts from the area where its large radius interaction occurred, it will have a base speed of 1.87 m/s
        ●When The Twins attempts to hunt, the crucifix check will be applied at the ghost's current location. If The Twins decides to start its hunt at the site of its last large radius interaction, it will teleport to that location after the crucifix check

    Hunt Abilities - Can teleport to player
    Smudging Title - Smudging
    Smudging - 90 seconds
    Hints:
        ●The Wraith will never step in a salt pile, and therefore will never disturb them. This includes Tier III Salt during hunts, rendering it ineffective against one
        ●When the Wraith is not hunting, it has a chance to teleport to a random player, generating an EMF Level 2 reading at the location where it teleported to, with a 25% chance for this to be an EMF Level 5 reading instead. The Wraith will resume normal behaviour after teleporting
        ●Wraiths cannot and do not:
          ●Float off the ground, whether during hunts or manifestations. A Wraith cannot be identified by looking at its ghost model
          ●See through physical objects such as walls and doors
          ●Walk quietly; Wraiths will emit footstep noises at the same volume as most other ghosts
          ●Walk through walls, even during hunts; they can only walk through doors (which all other ghosts are also able to do)

    Smudging Title - Smudging
    Smudging - 90 seconds
    Hints:
        ●Utilizing voice chat near the Yokai at any sanity will increase its rate of activity
        ●When a Music Box is used, the Yokai must be closer to the box (within 2.5 metres instead of 5) for it to trigger the ghost event and eventual cursed hunt
        ●When at least one player uses voice chat in the same room as the Yokai, its hunt sanity threshold is temporarily increased to 80%. Otherwise, it has the standard threshold of 50%
        ●During hunts, a Yokai can only hear players or sense handheld active electronics that are within 2.5 meters of it. Its line-of-sight is unaffected

    Hunt - 50%
    Hunt Abilities Title - Special Abilities
    Hunt Abilities - Can fully close a door
    Smudging Title - Smudging
    Smudging - 90 seconds
    Hints:
        ●When Incense is used on the Yurei, in addition to preventing hunts and temporarily increasing activity, it will return to its favourite room and be trapped within it for 90 seconds, stopping it from roaming through the location. It can still leave that room by performing a ghost event, but it will return to it once the event ends. If the Yurei is affected by incense during a hunt, it will only be trapped in its favourite room after the hunt ends for the remaining time of the cleansing effect
        ●Outside of its ability, the Yurei doesn't have an increased chance to interact with doors
        ●When choosing to use its ability, the Yurei will first check if its current room has an opened door. Doors that count for this ability are mostly room doors, as well as exit doors, large tent doors on campsites, Dining Room cabinet doors and Living Room/Games Room fireplace doors on Point Hope, and washing machine doors on Sunny Meadows. Hiding spot doors, however, do not count
        ●If the check is successful, the following is caused:
          ●All players within 7.5 metres of the ghost will have their sanity decreased by 15%. Players outside the investigation area will not be affected by the sanity drain
          ●The ghost will randomly select one opened door in the room and close it fully. This in turn produces two EMF 2 interactions on that door
            ●All ghosts can shut a door in the same way the Yurei can, however the Yurei will do this much more frequently as it is connected to its sanity drain ability
            ●Large tent doors will not fully close
